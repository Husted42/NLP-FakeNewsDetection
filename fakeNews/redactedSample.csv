for many religious people the message of jesus is to help others before yourself, to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit. the sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives. jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time – but what would a generous act look like in our times? that was the focus of the sermon.

the potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation, who were so moved they had to take action! after the sermon ended, the congregation decided to take an offering. a bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this christmas eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears.

what did they do with this offering? members of the congregation drove down to the local waffle house to visit the ladies working the night shift. what a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families!

the ladies working at waffle house clearly were not with their families. they had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills. the congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies, and wanted to help them out. they donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at waffle house.

in total that amounted to $3,500 being split amongst the staff. what a beautiful moment! what a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon! doing a good deed like this on christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at waffle house. sure, they could not see their families, but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community.

perhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return. it was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain. it speaks volumes about the merits of the church in our daily lives. this simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"church congregation brings gift to waitresses working on christmas eve, has them crying (video)",ruth harris,,[''],,,

stranded in the forest with jason on his heels, kyle must push his survival skills to their limits if he hopes to survive the night.

otherwise, he'll wind up as another lost victim of the cursed camp.

3,768,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/elusive-alien-of-the-sea-caught-by-scientist-for-one-of-the-first-times-ever-video/,"when a rare shark was caught, scientists were left blundering for answers. this shark has a unique feature. and it’s not that it can survive at extreme depths or live for an extended period of time. this shark’s unique trait is that it can extend its jaw in a telescoping fashion beyond its mouth. if you’ve ever seen the hit science fiction movie “alien,” this shark is that monster made manifest on earth. this shark stalks its prey and then lashes out with its telescoping teeth to snatch large fish and swallow them in one bite. it’s a deadly predator of the deep sea.

besides its telescoping teeth, this shark can glow in the dark and was only recently discovered back in 1986. in the three decades since it was first found, just a select few of this exotic shark species have been found.

but during a routine survey in the donghe township in taiwan, the country’s fisheries research institute found five of these horrifying deep-sea sharks.

the team was notably horrified and described “the most obvious feature are the needle-shaped teeth, like snake-like fangs. this is also the origin of viper shark name.”

that’s right. this beast is called the viper shark. and as you can tell by its name, it is ferocious with its prey.

although researchers have gotten their hands on a few of these animals, little is known about them. but researchers think these creatures swim between 300-400 meters under the surface of the ocean during the day to 150 meters below at night. could this be because of temperature changes or is it something to do with light?

the last five specimens were trawled up from a depth of 350 meters below the surface of the sea. four were already dead. but a living specimen was immediately immersed in cool seawater. but it could not handle the sudden change in its habitat. it perished just a day later.

while viper sharks look like the alien monster from the movie, they do not feed on humans. their main food sources are crustaceans and bony fishes. one of their favorite lunch items is the lanternfish. these creatures might be attracted toward the shark because of their glow-in-the-dark bodies. and when they swim close enough, the shark lashes out with its extendable jaw and snatches the fish up and devours it whole.

the first specimens of viper shark were found off the coast of shikoku island in japan in 1986. bottom-trawler vessel seiryo-maru was the first to haul these creatures up to the surface of the sea.

because the fish was a new discovery at the time, it’s scientific name honors the seiryo-maru captain, hiromichi kabeya. the shark’s scientific name was trigonognathus kabeyai.

although not much about these fish are known, scientists classify them in as a dogfish shark. they have only been found in the deep parts of the pacific ocean.

how would you react if this shark came up on the other end of your fishing line? would you think you were having a nightmare?",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,elusive ‘alien of the sea ‘ caught by scientist for one of the first times ever (video),alexander smith,,[''],,,

the new abc news/washington post poll came out after the president’s physician gave him a physical and mental exam. the doctor gave trump a clean bill of health, added an inch to his height, and claimed he was fit to serve for seven more years.

this poll was able to capture americans’ opinions after a new book came out indicating that people around trump questioned his emotional stability and ability to hold office. in addition, the new poll gave the respondents the time to hear trump tell the public that he was a “very stable genius” before they were interviewed. he said:

‘actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.’

the abc/washington post poll discovered that 21 percent of the people it interviewed believed that the president was a genius. that left a full 73 percent who saw through that lie.

then, there was the question of trump’s mental stability. the poll found that there was a nearly even divide throughout the nation. when asked if the president was stable, 47 percent of those interviewed said he was not, but 48 percent believed he is stable.

the abc news/washington post poll was taken from january 15 through 18, 2018. the random sample consisted of 1,005 adults interviewed by landline and cell phone in both english and spanish. the margin of error was +/- 3.5 percentage points.

let us have a look at the data for today

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

in silver, the total open interest fell by a tiny 76 contracts from 200,061 falling to 199,985 with yesterday’s 6 cent loss in silver pricing. we thus minimal comex liquidation. however, we were again notified that we had another huge sized number of comex longs transferring their contracts to london through the efp route: 2598 efp’s for march and zero for other months and thus total issuance of 2598 contracts. however the movement across to london is not as severe as in gold as there seems to be major players willing to take on the banks at the comex. still, with the transfer of 2598 contracts, what the cme is stating is that there is no silver (or gold) to be delivered upon at the comex as they must export their obligation to london. also keep in mind that there can be a delay of 24 hrs in the issuing of efp’s.

accumulation for efp’s/silver/ starting from first day notice/for month of january:

37,797 contracts (for 17 trading days total 37,797 contracts or 188.98 million oz: average per day: 2223 contracts or 11.116 million oz/day)

to give you an idea as to the huge supply this month in silver: so far this month: 188.98 million paper oz have morphed over to london. this represents around 26.99% of annual global production

result: a tiny sized loss in oi comex despite the 6 cent loss in silver price which usually indicates another failed banker short-covering. we also had a huge sized efp issuance of 2598 contracts which exited out of the silver comex and transferred their oi to london as forwards. speculators continued their interest in attacking the silver comex for physical silver . from the cme data 2598 efp’s were issued for today for a deliverable forward contract over in london with a fiat bonus. we really gained 2522 oi contracts i.e. 2598 open interest contracts headed for london (efp’s) together with a decrease of 76 oi comex contracts. and all of this happened with the fall in price of silver of 6 cents and a closing price of $16.92 with respect to yesterday’s trading. yet we still have a good amount of silver standing at the comex.

in ounces at the comex, the oi is still represented by just under 1 billion oz i.e. 0.999 billion to be exact or 141% of annual global silver production (ex russia & ex china).

for the new front january month/ they filed: 10 notice(s) for 50,000 oz of silver

in gold, the open interest surprisingly rose by a considerable 9126 contracts up to582,421 with the good sized rise in price of gold with yesterday’s trading ($5.55). in another huge development, we received the total number of gold efp’s issued for wednesday and it totaled a humongous sized 12,223 contracts of which february saw 11,023 contracts issued and april saw the issuance of 1200 contracts. the new oi for the gold complex rests at 583,590. also remember that there can be a delay in the issuance of efp’s. the bankers remove long positions of comex gold immediately. then they orchestrate their private efp deal with the longs and that could take an additional 48 hrs so we generally do not get a match with respect to departing comex longs and new efp long transfers. demand for gold intensifies greatly as we continue to witness a huge number of efp transfers together with the massive increase in gold comex oi together with the total amount of gold ounces standing for january comex. even though the bankers issued these monstrous efps, the obligation still rests with the bankers to supply metal but it transfers the risk to a london banker obligation and not a new york comex obligation. longs receive a fiat bonus together with a long london forward. thus, by these actions, the bankers at the comex have just stated that they have no appreciable metal!! this is a massive fraud: they cannot supply any metal to our comex longs but they are quite willing to supply massive non backed gold (and silver) paper knowing that they have no metal to satisfy our longs. london is now severely backward in both gold and silver (big rise in both gofo and sifo) and we are witnessing delays in actual deliveries. in essence today we have a huge gain of 21,349 contracts: 9126 oi contracts increased at the comex and a good sized 12,223 oi contracts which navigated over to london. expect huge numbers of efp’s to be issued as we approach first day notice in the gold feb comex contract, wednesday jan 31.2018

yesterday, we had 11,759 efp’s issued.

accumulation of efp’s/ gold(exchange for physical) for the month of january starting with first day notice: 164,474 contracts or 16.474 million oz or 512.41 tonnes(17 trading days and thus averaging: 9674 efp contracts per trading day or 967,400 oz/day)

to give you an idea as to the huge size of these efp transfers : so far this month in 17 trading days: in tonnes: 513 tonnes

total annual gold production, 2017, throughout the world ex china ex russia: 2200 tonnes

thus efp transfers represents 474/2200 tonnes = 23.31% of global annual production so far in january alone.

result: a shockingly strong sized increase in oi at the comex with the fair sized rise in price in gold trading on yesterday ($5.55). we had another gigantic sized number of comex long transferring to london through the efp route: 12,223. there obviously does not seem to be much physical gold at the comex and yet we also observed a huge delivery month for the month of december. i guess it explains the huge issuance of efp’s…there is hardly any gold present at the gold comex for delivery purposes. if you take into account the 12,223 efp contracts issued, we had a net gain in open interest of 21,349 contracts on the two exchanges:

12,223 contracts move to london and 9,126 contracts increased at the comex. (in tonnes, the gain in total oi equates to 70.03 tonnes).

we had: 8 notice(s) filed upon for 800 oz of gold.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

with respect to our two criminal funds, the gld and the slv:

gld

with gold up $25.00, we had a huge change in gold inventory at the gld/a deposit of 2.65 tonnes

inventory rests tonight: 849.32 tonnes.

slv/

a big changes in silver inventory at the slv/a huge withdrawal of 1.131 million oz from the slv inventory/

inventory rests at 313.048 million oz/

end

first, here is an outline of what will be discussed tonight:

1. today, we had the open interest in silver fell by a tiny 76 contracts from 200,061 down to 199,985 (and now a little further to the new comex record set on friday/april 21/2017 at 234,787) with the fall in price of silver to the tune of 5 cents with respect to yesterday’s trading. our bankers used their emergency procedure to issue another good 2598 private efp’s for march (we do not get a look at these contracts as it is private but the cftc does audit them) and 0 efp’s for all other months . efp’s give our comex longs a fiat bonus plus a deliverable product over in london. we had zero comex silver comex liquidation. if we take the oi loss at the comex of 76 contractsto the 2598 oi transferred to london through efp’s we obtain a big gain of 2522 open interest contracts. we still have a good amount of silver ounces that are standing for metal in january (see below). the net gain today in oz on the two exchanges: 12.61 million oz!!!

result: a small sized decrease in silver oi at the comex despite the tiny fall of 6 cents in price (with respect to yesterday’s trading). but we also had another strong 2598 efp’s issued transferring comex longs over to london. together with the good sized amount of silver ounces standing for january, demand for physical silver intensifies as we witness major bank short covering accompanied by increases in gofo and sifo rates indicating scarcity.

it’s not really president trump who needs his mouth washed out with soap



throwing the spotlight on so-called men of the cloth: it’s not president donald trump who needs to have his mouth washed out with soap for having allegedly made use of the vulgar ‘s’ word at a white house meeting on immigration. there’s just no getting around it that some words are more painful than cuss words, particularly when they heap praise on abortion advocates. “members of president trump’s evangelical advisory council decided to jump ship for the day and publicly sided with nancy pelosi on daca. (redstate, jan. 18, 2018)

“you have always taken the lead. your commitment to the immigrant community to the ‘dreamers’ is second to none. so america is in a better place because of your prophetic leadership on this matter,” the rev.samuel rodriguez, who spoke at trump’s inauguration last year, told pelosi at a press conference on thursday.” prophetic? really?” pelosi, of course, is one of the loudest advocates of abortion ever elected, coming second only to former president barack obama, champion of partial birth abortion. how sincere was rev. rodriguez when he raised the name of president donald trump in prayer at his inauguration? discomfited by the president’s use of an expression he has denied using, rev. rodriguez, a member of the “unofficial” evangelical advisory board and the president of the national hispanic christian leadership conference noted that “every single person is created in the image of god” and spoke of welcoming people equally from nigeria and norway, albeit after “a rigorous vetting process.” “later in the day, he said more: “in addition, and with great due deference, i believe that the comments attributed to our president can best be described as wrong, inappropriate, and hurtful. why? because when god looks at these nations, he sees his children.” (yahoo, jan. 15, 2018)

it should go without saying that our creator sees among “his children, millions of babies killed in their mother’s wombs. sadly, the pastor is not the only one who hypocritically regards the president’s alleged use of the ‘s’ word as more preach-worthy than the open advocation of abortion. isn’t it more than a tad hypocritical, if not downright sanctimonious that the vatican newspaper, l’osservatore romano would try a wash-his-mouth-with-soap stance on the latest alleged expletive of president donald trump? we all know by now that president trump’s alleged use of the ‘s’ word was tattle-taled to the internet world by catholic u.s. senator dick durbin, who went straight to the media to report the vulgarity had been “repeatedly” used at a white house meeting on immigration. tattletale dicky durbin

continued below... the newspaper, l’osservatore romano—the vatican’s flagship—gave trump’s comments about the immigration debate in the united states, front page attention, noting the comments had immediately sparked “controversy and indignation”. never mind that trump denies using the term. mercifully, the newspaper did not print the vulgar word that automatically spiralled the democrats into a full-on faux rage. no, none of that over here. but it’s not just vulgar expletives that rile people up. some words indiscriminately used to honor abortion advocates are just as—if not more—offensive to the faithful. some some pro-life catholics must have thought of the ‘s’ word when reading on twitter that abortion advocate lilianne ploumen, former minister for foreign trade and development cooperation in the netherlands, was recently honored by pope francis with the title of ‘commander in the pontifical equestrian order of st. gregory the great’. this was one tweet that turned out to be as troubling as it was true: “the lepanto institute was able to confirm from a december 22, 2017 dutch radio broadcast that ploumen indeed received the honor. in a brief video clip promoting the broadcast, ploumen displays the medal while saying that she received it from the pope. (lepanto institute, jan.12, 2018)

“to say that lilianne ploumen is “pro-abortion” is an extreme understatement and doesn’t even come close to the scandalous reality of her activism. “in january of last year, after us president donald trump reinstated the mexico city policy, ploumen launched a new ngo called she decides to provide mass amounts of funds to organizations that would no longer receive funds from the us government. the mexico city policy automatically denies us funding for international organizations which perform or promote abortion. “referring to the mexico city policy as a “global gag rule,” ploumen stated that the intention of she decides was to continue support for existing programs being run by organizations such as the united nations population fund (unpfa), the international planned parenthood federation and marie stopes international. she said, “these are successful and effective programs: direct support, distributing condoms, making sure women are accompanied at the birth, and making sure abortion is safe if they have no other choice.” the lepanto institute continues their ploumen profile: “but ploumen’s anti-catholic activity isn’t restricted to abortion. in september of 2017, ploumen participated in the united nations lgbti core group. as the first speaker at the event, ploumen noted that “lgbti rights are human rights.” in her opening remarks, she said, “we cannot be complacent. [today] in more than 70 countries homosexuality is still criminalized…stigma against lgbt people continue all over the world.” “in 2014, ploumen ended foreign aid to the country of uganda for passing a bill banning sodomy and same-sex “marriage.” in february of 2010, ploumen called on lgbt activists to descend upon and disrupt mass at st. john the baptist cathedral, wearing pink triangles with the words “jesus excludes no one.” “the reason? she and other pro-lgbt activists were protesting the church’s moral teaching regarding homosexuality.”

continued below... we already know how pope francis profiles president donald trump: “in 2016, in response to a question about then-candidate trump’s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall along the u.s. border with mexico, francis said a man with such views was “not christian”. (reuters, jan. 12, 2018) “trump, who grew up in a presbyterian family, shot back saying it was “disgraceful” for the pope to question his faith.” actions speak so much louder than cuss words. thousands will be taking part in the 2018 march for life today. neither rev. rodriguez nor pope francis will be there, but president trump will be, addressing the crowd by satellite.

headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!

by andrew c. mccarthy / family security matters

new fbi texts highlight a motive to conceal the president’s involvement.

from the first, these columns have argued that the whitewash of the hillary clinton-emails caper was president barack obama’s call – not the fbi’s, and not the justice department’s. (see, e.g., here, here, and here.) the decision was inevitable. obama, using a pseudonymous email account, had repeatedly communicated with secretary clinton over her private, non-secure email account.

these emails must have involved some classified information, given the nature of consultations between presidents and secretaries of state, the broad outlines of obama’s own executive order defining classified intelligence (see eo 13526, section 1.4), and the fact that the obama administration adamantly refused to disclose the clinton-obama emails. if classified information was mishandled, it was necessarily mishandled on both ends of these email exchanges.

if clinton had been charged, obama’s culpable involvement would have been patent. in any prosecution of clinton, the clinton-obama emails would have been in the spotlight. for the prosecution, they would be more proof of willful (or, if you prefer, grossly negligent) mishandling of intelligence. more significantly, for clinton’s defense, they would show that obama was complicit in clinton’s conduct yet faced no criminal charges.

that is why such an indictment of hillary clinton was never going to happen. the latest jaw-dropping disclosures of text messages between fbi agent peter strzok and his paramour, fbi lawyer lisa page, illustrate this point.

for the moment, i want to put aside the latest controversy – the fbi’s failure to retain five months of text messages between strzok and page, those chattiest of star-crossed lovers. yes, this “glitch” closes our window on a critical time in the trump-russia investigation: mid december 2016 through mid may 2017. that is when the bureau and justice department were reportedly conducting and renewing (in 90-day intervals) court-approved fisa surveillance that may well have focused on the newly sworn-in president of the united states. (remember: the bureau’s then-director, james comey, testified at a march 20 house intelligence committee hearing that the investigation was probing possible coordination with trump’s campaign and kremlin interference in the election.)

the retention default has been chalked up to a technological mishap. assuming that this truly was an indiscriminate, bureau-wide problem – that lost texts are not limited to phones involved in the trump-russia investigation – it is hard to imagine its going undetected for five months in an agency whose business is information retention. but it is not inconceivable. attorney general jeff sessions maintains that an aggressive inquiry is underway, so let’s assume (for argument’s sake, at least) that either the texts will be recovered or a satisfactory explanation for their non-retention will be forthcoming.

for now, let’s stick with the clinton-obama emails.

only july 5, 2016, comey held the press conference at which he delivered a statement describing mrs. clinton’s criminal conduct but nevertheless recommending against an indictment. we now know that comey’s remarks had been in the works for two months and were revised several times by the director and his advisers.

this past weekend, in a letter to the fbi regarding the missing texts, senate homeland security committee chairman ron johnson (r., wis.) addressed some of these revisions. according to senator johnson, a draft dated june 30, 2016 (i.e., five days before comey delivered the final version), contained a passage expressly referring to a troublesome email exchange between clinton and obama. (i note that the fbi’s report of its eventual interview of clinton contains a cryptic reference to a july 1, 2012, email that clinton sent from russia to obama’s email address. see report, page 2.) the passage in the june 30 draft stated:

we also assess that secretary clinton’s use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. she also used her personal email extensively while outside the united states, including from the territory of sophisticated adversaries. that use included an email exchange with the president while secretary clinton was on the territory of such an adversary. [emphasis added.] given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to secretary clinton’s personal email account.

on the same day, according to a strzok-page text, a revised draft of comey’s remarks was circulated by his chief of staff, jim rybicki. it replaced “the president” with “another senior government official.”

this effort to obscure obama’s involvement had an obvious flaw: it would practically have begged congressional investigators and enterprising journalists to press for the identification of the “senior government official” with whom clinton had exchanged emails. that was not going to work.

consequently, by the time comey delivered his remarks on july 5, the decision had been made to avoid even a veiled allusion to obama. instead, all the stress was placed on clinton (who was not going to be charged anyway) for irresponsibly sending and receiving sensitive emails that were likely to have been penetrated by hostile intelligence services. comey made no reference to clinton’s correspondent:

we also assess that secretary clinton’s use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. she also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the united states, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. [emphasis added.] given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to secretary clinton’s personal e-mail account.

the decision to purge any reference to obama is consistent with the panic that seized his administration from the moment clinton’s use of a private, non-secure server system was revealed in early march 2015. i detailed this reaction in a series of 2016 columns (see, e.g., here and here). what most alarmed obama and clinton advisers (those groups overlap) was not only that there were several clinton-obama email exchanges, but also that obama dissembled about his knowledge of clinton’s private email use in a nationally televised interview.

on march 4, just after the new york times broke the news about clinton’s email practices at the state department, john podesta (a top obama adviser and clinton’s campaign chairman) emailed cheryl mills (clinton’s confidant and top aide in the obama state department) to suggest that clinton’s “emails to and from potus” should be “held” – i.e., not disclosed – because “that’s the heart of his exec privilege.” at the time, the house committee investigating the benghazi jihadist attack was pressing for production of clinton’s emails.

as his counselors grappled with how to address his own involvement in clinton’s misconduct, obama deceptively told cbs news in a march 7 interview that he had found out about clinton’s use of personal email to conduct state department business “the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.” perhaps he was confident that, because he had used an alias in communicating with clinton, his emails to and from her – estimated to number around 20 – would remain undiscovered.

his and clinton’s advisers were not so confident. right after the interview aired, clinton campaign secretary josh scherwin emailed jennifer palmieri and other senior campaign staffers, stating: “jen you probably have more on this but it looks like potus just said he found out hrc was using her personal email when he saw it on the news.”

scherwin’s alert was forwarded to mills. shortly afterwards, an agitated mills emailed podesta: “we need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov.” (that is, obama had emails from clinton, which he had to know were from a private account since her address did not end in “@state.gov” as state department emails do.)

so how did obama and his helpers “clean this up”?

obama had his email communications with clinton sealed. he did this by invoking a dubious presidential-records privilege. the white house insisted that the matter had nothing to do with the contents of the emails, of course; rather, it was intended to vindicate the principle of confidentiality in presidential communications with close advisers. with the media content to play along, this had a twofold benefit: obama was able (1) to sidestep disclosure without acknowledging that the emails contained classified information and (2) to avoid using the term “executive privilege” – with all its dark watergate connotations – even though that was precisely what he was invoking.

note that claims of executive privilege must yield to demands for disclosure of relevant evidence in criminal prosecutions. but of course, that’s not a problem if there will be no prosecution.

the white house purported to repair the president’s disingenuous statement in the cbs interview by rationalizing that he had meant that he learned of clinton’s homebrew server system through news reports – he hadn’t meant to claim unawareness that she occasionally used private email. this was sheer misdirection: from obama’s standpoint, the problem was that he discussed government intelligence matters with the secretary of state through a private email account; the fact that, in addition, clinton’s private email account was connected to her own private server system, rather than some other private email service, was beside the point. but, again, the media was not interested in such distinctions and contentedly accepted the white house’s non-explanation.

meanwhile, attorney general loretta lynch ordered comey to use the word “matter” rather than “investigation” to describe the fbi’s probe of clinton’s email practices. this ensured that the democratic administration’s law-enforcement agencies were aligning their story with the democratic candidate’s campaign rhetoric. if there was no investigation, there would be no prosecution.

in april 2016, in another nationally televised interview, obama made clear that he did not want clinton to be indicted. his rationale was a legally frivolous straw man: clinton had not intended to harm national security. this was not an element of the felony offenses she had committed; nor was it in dispute. no matter: obama’s analysis was the stated view of the chief executive. if, as was sure to happen, his subordinates in the executive law-enforcement agencies conformed their decisions to his stated view, there would be no prosecution.

within a few weeks, even though the investigation was ostensibly still underway and over a dozen key witnesses – including clinton herself – had not yet been interviewed, the fbi began drafting comey’s remarks that would close the investigation. there would be no prosecution.

on june 27, lynch met with clinton’s husband, former president bill clinton, on an out-of-the-way arizona tarmac, where their security details arranged for both their planes to be parked.

over the next few days, the fbi took pains to strike any reference to obama’s emails with mrs. clinton from the statement in which comey would effectively end the “matter” with no prosecution.

on july 1, amid intense public criticism of her meeting with bill clinton, attorney general lynch piously announced that she would accept whatever recommendation the fbi director and career prosecutors made about charging clinton. as page told strzok in a text that day, “this is a purposeful leak following the airplane snafu.” it was also playacting. page elaborated that the attorney general already “knows no charges will be brought.” of course she did: it was understood by all involved that there would be no prosecution.

knowing that, lynch had given the fbi notice on june 30 that she’d be announcing her intention to accept comey’s recommendation. fearing this just might look a bit choreographed, the fbi promptly amended comey’s planned remarks to include this assertion (which he in fact made on july 5): “i have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the department of justice or any other part of the government. they do not know what i am about to say.”

but they did not need to participate in drafting the statement, and they did not need to know the precise words he was going to use. it was not comey’s decision anyway. all they needed to know was that there would be no prosecution.

on july 2, with the decision that she would not be indicted long since made, mrs. clinton sat for an interview with the fbi – something she’d never have done if there were a chance she might be charged. the farce was complete with the justice department and fbi permitting two subjects of the investigation – mills and clinton aide heather samuelson – to sit in on the interview as lawyers representing clinton. that is not something law enforcement abides when it is serious about making a case. here, however, it was clear: there would be no prosecution.

all cleaned up: no indictment, meaning no prosecution, meaning no disclosure of clinton-obama emails. it all worked like a charm . . . except the part where mrs. clinton wins the presidency and the problem is never spoken of again.

""fake news"" is now part of the american vernacular, and wordsmiths have donald trump to thank.

president trump recently handed out the 2017 ""fake news awards"" for the 11 most irresponsible examples of reporting. and the headlines, ranging from ice cream to pecan pie, bordered on—if not crossed—the ridiculous. trump's ""favorite"" media outlet, cnn, garnered four of the awards.

but long before last week's awards, donald trump was calling out those who just plain didn't get the story straight, even on the campaign trail. and his boldness resonated with voters, says stephen e. strang, author of the best-selling book, god and donald trump.

strang, who was a guest on fox & friends this past sunday, said that when then-candidate trump began responding to his critics at all hours of the day and night on twitter, he surprised and embarrassed a lot of his detractors, tweeting strongly worded comments no one had expected.

""he had already waged highly publicized verbal battles with meryl streep and other celebrities such as rosie o'donnell and oprah winfrey, but this would be an altogether different kind of war,"" strang wrote. ""with a level of technical savvy uncommon for a man of his generation, trump was able to counterattack within minutes whenever his opponents made scurrilous charges against him. this was something new, and it delighted his fans and the public at large, even as it infuriated the increasingly volatile resistance.

""before long, trump was a serial tweeter, and he provided the media with some riveting sound bites,"" he continued. ""not everyone, of course, was thrilled by this new development. liberal news organizations compiled exhaustive catalogs of trump's tweets to show how insensitive, ignorant and wrong-headed he could be. but they couldn't ignore them, and they followed his tweets faithfully, hoping to catch him in some word or deed that would be his undoing.""

strang fully acknowledges that some of trump's comments were tactless and crude, often attacking his detractors with salty schoolyard taunts.

""but trump's use of twitter gave him a way around the mainstream media and his political opponents who had been getting free access to the media and were able to insult and demean him with impunity,"" strang wrote. ""suddenly, those same people were being held accountable in real time, and news hawks on both sides didn't want to miss a word of it.

""trump hasn't slowed his twitter storm since moving into the white house,"" the author added. ""at one point, he had said there would have been 'zero chance of winning wh' if he had relied on the 'fake news' being churned out by the mainstream media. but his candid and unfiltered twitter feeds helped turn the tables on his foes.""

strang is an award-winning journalist and successful businessman who began his career as a newspaper reporter at the orlando sentinel. he later founded a christian publishing house and media company while interviewing and writing about nearly every christian leader in the country over the past four decades.

vatican city, jan 24, 2018 / 04:26 am (cna/ewtn news).- in his message for the world day of social communications, published wednesday, pope francis said that in a world of lightning-fast communication, there is a responsibility to combat falsehood and misinformation with truth, treating journalism as a people-oriented mission.

“in today’s world, [the work of journalists] is, in every sense, not just a job; it is a mission,” the pope wrote in his message released jan. 24.

“amid feeding frenzies and the mad rush for a scoop, they must remember that the heart of information is not the speed with which it is reported or its audience impact, but persons.”

“informing others means forming others; it means being in touch with people’s lives,” he continued. “that is why ensuring the accuracy of sources and protecting communication are real means of promoting goodness, generating trust, and opening the way to communion and peace.”

francis’ message for the next world day of social communications was released jan. 24, the feast day of st. francis de sales, the patron saint of journalists.



the 52nd annual celebration will take place may 13, 2018, on the theme: “‘the truth will set you free’ (jn 8:32). fake news and journalism for peace.”

“in today’s fast-changing world of communications and digital systems, we are witnessing the spread of what has come to be known as ‘fake news,’” the pope said.

“in this way, i would like to contribute to our shared commitment to stemming the spread of fake news and to rediscovering the dignity of journalism and the personal responsibility of journalists to communicate the truth.”

the best “antidote” to the spread of falsehoods in ‘fake news’ aren’t strategies, he stated, but people.

“people who are not greedy but ready to listen, people who make the effort to engage in sincere dialogue so that the truth can emerge; people who are attracted by goodness and take responsibility for how they use language.”

everyone has the duty to counter the lies found in ‘fake news,’ he said. but an even weightier responsibility falls upon those whose job it is to provide the world with information, namely, journalists, the “protectors of news.”

francis went on to encourage everyone to promote “a journalism of peace,” which he said doesn’t mean some saccharine or sentimental reporting that refuses to acknowledge the existence of real and serious problems.

rather, he emphasized, a journalism of peace is journalism that is “truthful and opposed to falsehoods, rhetorical slogans, and sensational headlines. a journalism created by people for people, one that is at the service of all, especially those – and they are the majority in our world – who have no voice.”

a journalism, he continued, that is less focused on breaking news, and more on exploring the underlying causes of conflicts, so that it can promote a deeper understanding and contribute to resolutions “by setting in place virtuous processes” and offering alternatives to “shouting matches.”

the first ‘fake news,’ francis said, was that created by the “crafty serpent” in the book of genesis, who used falsehood to tempt eve into disobeying god.

“the strategy of this skilled ‘father of lies’ (jn 8:44) is precisely mimicry, that sly and dangerous form of seduction that worms its way into the heart with false and alluring arguments,” he said.

eve’s temptation by the serpent “brings to light an essential element for our reflection: there is no such thing as harmless disinformation.”

he pointed out how constant exposure to deceptive language can also have harmful consequences on our interior life, as illustrated by a quote from fyodor dostoevsky’s the brothers karamazov.

“people who lie to themselves and listen to their own lie come to such a pass that they cannot distinguish the truth within them, or around them, and so lose all respect for themselves and for others. and having no respect, they cease to love, and in order to occupy and distract themselves without love they give way to passions and to coarse pleasures, and sink to bestiality in their vices, all from continual lying to others and to themselves.”

so how do we defend ourselves from this evil, francis asked. “the most radical antidote to the virus of falsehood is purification by the truth,” which in christianity is more than just a judgment of things as true or false, he said.

it’s also more than just revealing things that are concealed, he continued: “truth involves our whole life.”

“truth is something you can lean on, so as not to fall,” he said. “in this relational sense, the only truly reliable and trustworthy one – the one on whom we can count – is the living god. hence, jesus can say: ‘i am the truth.’”

“to this end, drawing inspiration from a franciscan prayer, we might turn to the truth in person,” he concluded, offering the following prayer:

“lord, make us instruments of your peace.

help us to recognize the evil latent in a communication that does not build communion.

help us to remove the venom from our judgements.

help us to speak about others as our brothers and sisters.

you are faithful and trustworthy; may our words be seeds of goodness for the world:

where there is shouting, let us practice listening;

where there is confusion, let us inspire harmony;

where there is ambiguity, let us bring clarity;

where there is exclusion, let us offer solidarity;

where there is sensationalism, let us use sobriety;

where there is superficiality, let us raise real questions;

where there is prejudice, let us awaken trust;

where there is hostility, let us bring respect;

where there is falsehood, let us bring truth.

amen.”

they got extra testing done and went to an oncologist who revealed the terminal diagnosis.

""just a few days ago we got the word that it's stage 4 lung cancer. that's a shock, especially with someone who's always been as healthy as dad,"" he continued.

the son said they made the video so that people can join them in prayer. luis then shared his heart concerning everything.

""i haven't been in a hospital one night except for when i broke a bone back in 1984 after missions from london,"" the esteemed argentinian evangelist shared.

""to me, the first thing you do is cry. i think 'oh wow, i can be gone in a few months' and one silly thought that came to mind is that i won't be able to pick up the phone and talk to the boys and hear their voice and talk to my wife,"" luis emotionally shared.

""this is sad, i don't feel panic or horror, if [i'm] healed, hallelujah! and many people are praying that the lord will do a miracle. it would take literally a miracle medically speaking. stage 4 is big time.""

he went on to say that the peace he felt immediately was that at least 10 years ago he elected his son, kevin, to be president of the ministry and andrew is an anointed evangelist.

""so everything is ready and if the lord wants to take me home in the next two months or two years, then i'm ready,"" the loving father maintained as his sons looked at him with heartbroken smiles.

luis said he's going to continue living one day at a time and despite the sad prognosis he still feels good.

he shared the scripture that has been keeping him encouraged: isaiah 41:10, which says, ""fear not, for i am with you; be not dismayed, for i am your god. i will strengthen you and help you; i will uphold you with my victorious righteous right arm.""

""i know the lord is with me, by the holy spirit indwelling, he is with us, we go through it, we go into the presence of the lord,"" luis testified.

he also shared 2 timothy 4 where the apostle paul says, ""the time for my departure is here.""

the 83-year-old began to cry as he thought about leaving his family but he did say he still intends to complete the mission trips they have planned throughout the world for this year as god gives him the strength.

""thank you for your prayers, thank you for loving us, thank you for your support,"" luis said as he ended his portion.

andrew concluded the video by saying that he's had many restless nights the past couple of days.

""i got up and read my proverbs early and couldn't wait to come up and see your face,"" he told his dad.

he then quoted proverbs 15, which says, ""the evidence of a happy heart is a cheerful face.""

""to think that you're facing what you're facing and day by day we see your happy face, it's proof that you're at peace,"" andrew stated.

""we beg you to pray for dad and mom,"" he asked viewers.

luis has been in ministry for more than 50 years. the palau association has collaborated with thousands of churches in hundreds of cities around the world in his life to this point. he's made an impact in top global cities: london, hong kong, singapore, chicago, moscow, madrid, mexico city, buenos aires, washington, d.c., and more.

this reporter was in attendance in 2015 as he rallied 1,000 new york city churches together to make history in the big apple. it was one of the biggest evangelical moves in new york city as approximately 60,000 people gathered to hear the gospel and worship. the palau association has coordinated hundreds of citywide campaigns just like it in dozens of nations, including major evangelistic festivals on all five continents.

a team of scientists in california have found a new way to create stem cells that doesn't require the destruction of human embryos.

researchers at the san francisco-based gladstone institute have announced that they were able to create stem cells by using skin cells from mice through a genome editing tool called crispr.

sheng ding, phd, a senior investigator at the gladstone institute, said in a statement released monday that this was an innovative means of creating stem cells for research.

""this is a new way to make induced pluripotent stem cells that is fundamentally different from how they've been created before,"" said ding.

""at the beginning of the study, we didn't think this would work, but we wanted to at least try to answer the question: can you reprogram a cell just by unlocking a specific location of the genome? and the answer is yes.""

in a statement, the gladstone institute noted that they were building upon the findings of senior investigator shinya yamanaka, md, phd, who in 2006 found that ""he could make stem cells — dubbed induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) — by treating ordinary skin cells with four key proteins.""

""ding and others previously created ipscs not with transcription factors, but by adding a cocktail of chemicals to the cells,"" noted the institute.

""the latest study, published in cell stem cell, offers a third way to turn skin cells into stem cells by directly manipulating the cells' genome using crispr gene regulation techniques.""

short for ""clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,"" crisprs are a type of dna sequences found in bacteria.

""crispr technology was adapted from the natural defense mechanisms of bacteria and archaea (the domain of single-celled microorganisms). these organisms use crispr-derived rna and various cas proteins, including cas9, to foil attacks by viruses and other foreign bodies,"" explained live science.

""they do so primarily by chopping up and destroying the dna of a foreign invader. when these components are transferred into other, more complex, organisms, it allows for the manipulation of genes, or 'editing.'""

the gladstone institute's breakthrough on stem cell creation comes months after an israeli-based firm developed a new als treatment that uses cells extracted from bone marrow rather than embryos.

brainstorm announced in october that it was beginning clinical treatments in the united states with the new treatment, which could help restore motor abilities for those with als.

""during the maturation process, the cells from the bone marrow are manipulated into behaving like brain cells, in that they produce materials that are the building blocks of the brain,"" reported the jerusalem post.

""when these modified cells are put back in patients, the building blocks circulate in the spinal fluid and help repair the damaged brain.""",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,scientists develop new method to create stem cells without killing human embryos,,,[''],a team of scientists in california have found a new way to create stem cells that doesn't require the destruction of human embryos.,,
