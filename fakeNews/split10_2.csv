technology allows drillers drill far 6 miles away laterally , example , directional drilling allows land-based rigs drill offshore locations , significantly reduces production expenses , oil located steep mountains likewise tapped nearby flatlands importantly iraq , directional drilling allows producers increase length underground pipe exposed reservoir instead simply end pipe inserted oil reservoir , directional drilling fairly long perated section pipe placed contact oil critically important ensuring high flows well completed , since oil sucked much larger surface area iraq directional drilling enables producers overcome sluggish flows resulted saddam ’ policy over-drawing oil wells reinjecting thick , undesirable residues back ground hopes obtaining short-term increases flow , mentioned , directional drilling also makes possible multiple wellheads draw oil single drilling site , extended length perated pipe exposed oil reservoir means greater yields likewise , directional drilling also allows single wellhead draw oil and/or gas within several different geologic strata ( layers rock ) different depths , something impossible older perpendicular drilling methods introduction directional drilling technologies helped iraq dramatically increase production , technologies hold promise even greater yields future hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing ,
