early form directional drilling allowed hole drilled slight angle directional drilling equipment allows drill bit move curving line rather straight line snake around underground obstacles unusually

drilling rig current technology allows drillers drill far <NUM> miles away laterally example directional drilling allows landbased rigs drill offshore locations significantly reduces production expenses oil located steep mountains likewise tapped nearby flatlands importantly iraq directional drilling allows producers increase length underground pipe exposed reservoir instead simply end pipe inserted oil reservoir directional drilling fairly long perforated section pipe placed contact oil critically important ensuring high flows well completed since oil sucked larger surface area iraq directional drilling enables producers overcome sluggish flows resulted saddam policy overdrawing oil wells reinjecting thick undesirable residues back ground hopes obtaining shortterm increases flow mentioned directional drilling makes possible multiple wellheads draw oil single drilling site extended length perforated pipe exposed oil reservoir means greater yields likewise directional drilling allows single wellhead draw oil / gas within several different geologic strata layers rock different depths something impossible older perpendicular drilling methods introduction directional drilling technologies helped iraq dramatically increase production technologies hold promise greater yields future hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing sometimes called fracking method stimulating wells
