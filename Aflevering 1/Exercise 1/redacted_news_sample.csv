the power of christmas will make you do wild and wonderful things. you do not need to believe in the holy trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others. the simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days, as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need. one congregation in ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on christmas eve. the pastor at grand lake united methodist church in celina, ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of jesus.for many religious people the message of jesus is to help others before yourself, to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit. the sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives. jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time – but what would a generous act look like in our times? that was the focus of the sermon.the potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation, who were so moved they had to take action! after the sermon ended, the congregation decided to take an offering. a bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this christmas eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears.what did they do with this offering? members of the congregation drove down to the local waffle house to visit the ladies working the night shift. what a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families!the ladies working at waffle house clearly were not with their families. they had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills. the congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies, and wanted to help them out. they donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at waffle house.in total that amounted to $<NUM>,<NUM> being split amongst the staff. what a beautiful moment! what a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon! doing a good deed like this on christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at waffle house. sure, they could not see their families, but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community.perhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return. it was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain. it speaks volumes about the merits of the church in our daily lives. this simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year.",<DATE>

left blundering for answers. this shark has a unique feature. and it’s not that it can survive at extreme depths or live for an extended period of time. this shark’s unique trait is that it can extend its jaw in a telescoping fashion beyond its mouth. if you’ve ever seen the hit science fiction movie “alien,” this shark is that monster made manifest on earth. this shark stalks its prey and then lashes out with its telescoping teeth to snatch large fish and swallow them in one bite. it’s a deadly predator of the deep sea.besides its telescoping teeth, this shark can glow in the dark and was only recently discovered back in <NUM>. in the three decades since it was first found, just a select few of this exotic shark species have been found.but during a routine survey in the donghe township in taiwan, the country’s fisheries research institute found five of these horrifying deep-sea sharks.the team was notably horrified and described “the most obvious feature are the needle-shaped teeth, like snake-like fangs. this is also the origin of viper shark name.”that’s right. this beast is called the viper shark. and as you can tell by its name, it is ferocious with its prey.although researchers have gotten their hands on a few of these animals, little is known about them. but researchers think these creatures swim between <NUM>-<NUM> meters under the surface of the ocean during the day to <NUM> meters below at night. could this be because of temperature changes or is it something to do with light?the last five specimens were trawled up from a depth of <NUM> meters below the surface of the sea. four were already dead. but a living specimen was immediately immersed in cool seawater. but it could not handle the sudden change in its habitat. it perished just a day later.while viper sharks look like the alien monster from the movie, they do not feed on humans. their main food sources are crustaceans and bony fishes. one of their favorite lunch items is the lanternfish. these creatures might be attracted toward the shark because of their glow-in-the-dark bodies. and when they swim close enough, the shark lashes out with its extendable jaw and snatches the fish up and devours it whole.the first specimens of viper shark were found off the coast of shikoku island in japan in <NUM>. bottom-trawler vessel seiryo-maru was the first to haul these creatures up to the surface of the sea.because the fish was a new discovery at the time, it’s scientific name honors the seiryo-maru captain, hiromichi kabeya. the shark’s scientific name was trigonognathus kabeyai.although not much about these fish are known, scientists classify them in as a dogfish shark. they have only been found in the deep parts of the pacific ocean.how would you react if this shark came up on the other end of your fishing line? would you think you were having a nightmare?",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE>

in gold as there seems to be major players willing to take on the banks at the comex. still, with the transfer of <NUM> contracts, what the cme is stating is that there is no silver (or gold) to be delivered upon at the comex as they must export their obligation to london. also keep in mind that there can be a delay of <NUM> hrs in the issuing of efp’s.accumulation for efp’s/silver/ starting from first day notice/for month of january:<NUM>,<NUM> contracts (for <NUM> trading days total <NUM>,<NUM> contracts or <NUM>.<NUM> million oz: average per day: <NUM> contracts or <NUM>.<NUM> million oz/day)to give you an idea as to the huge supply this month in silver: so far this month: <NUM>.<NUM> million paper oz have morphed over to london. this represents around <NUM>.<NUM>% of annual global productionresult: a tiny sized loss in oi comex despite the <NUM> cent loss in silver price which usually indicates another failed banker short-covering. we also had a huge sized efp issuance of <NUM> contracts which exited out of the silver comex and transferred their oi to london as forwards. speculators continued their interest in attacking the silver comex for physical silver . from the cme data <NUM> efp’s were issued for today for a deliverable forward contract over in london with a fiat bonus. we really gained <NUM> oi contracts i.e. <NUM> open interest contracts headed for london (efp’s) together with a decrease of <NUM> oi comex contracts. and all of this happened with the fall in price of silver of <NUM> cents and a closing price of $<NUM>.<NUM> with respect to yesterday’s trading. yet we still have a good amount of silver standing at the comex.in ounces at the comex, the oi is still represented by just under <NUM> billion oz i.e. <NUM>.<NUM> billion to be exact or <NUM>% of annual global silver production (ex russia & ex china).for the new front january month/ they filed: <NUM> notice(s) for <NUM>,<NUM> oz of silverin gold, the open interest surprisingly rose by a considerable <NUM> contracts up to<NUM>,<NUM> with the good sized rise in price of gold with yesterday’s trading ($<NUM>.<NUM>). in another huge development, we received the total number of gold efp’s issued for wednesday and it totaled a humongous sized <NUM>,<NUM> contracts of which february saw <NUM>,<NUM> contracts issued and april saw the issuance of <NUM> contracts. the new oi for the gold complex rests at <NUM>,<NUM>. also remember that there can be a delay in the issuance of efp’s. the bankers remove long positions of comex gold immediately. then they orchestrate their private efp deal with the longs and that could take an additional <NUM> hrs so we generally do not get a match with respect to departing comex longs and new efp long transfers. demand for gold intensifies greatly as we continue to witness a huge number of efp transfers together with the massive increase in gold comex oi together with the total amount of gold ounces standing for january comex. even though the bankers issued these monstrous efps, the obligation still rests with the bankers to supply metal but it transfers the risk to a london banker obligation and not a new york comex obligation. longs receive a fiat bonus together with a long london forward. thus, by these actions, the bankers at the comex have just stated that they have no appreciable metal!! this is a massive fraud: they cannot supply any metal to our comex longs but they are quite willing to supply massive non backed gold (and silver) paper knowing that they have no metal to satisfy our longs. london is now severely backward in both gold and silver (big rise in both gofo and sifo) and we are witnessing delays in actual deliveries. in essence today we have a huge gain of <NUM>,<NUM> contracts: <NUM> oi contracts increased at the comex and a good sized <NUM>,<NUM> oi contracts which navigated over to london. expect huge numbers of efp’s to be issued as we approach first day notice in the gold feb comex

trading on yesterday ($<NUM>.<NUM>). we had another gigantic sized number of comex long transferring to london through the efp route: <NUM>,<NUM>. there obviously does not seem to be much physical gold at the comex and yet we also observed a huge delivery month for the month of december. i guess it explains the huge issuance of efp’s…there is hardly any gold present at the gold comex for delivery purposes. if you take into account the <NUM>,<NUM> efp contracts issued, we had a net gain in open interest of <NUM>,<NUM> contracts on the two exchanges:<NUM>,<NUM> contracts move to london and <NUM>,<NUM> contracts increased at the comex.

(redstate, jan. <NUM>, <NUM>)“you have always taken the lead. your commitment to the immigrant community to the ‘dreamers’ is second to none. so america is in a better place because of your prophetic leadership on this matter,” the rev.samuel rodriguez, who spoke at trump’s inauguration last year, told pelosi at a press conference on thursday.” prophetic? really?” pelosi, of course, is one of the loudest advocates of abortion ever elected, coming second only to former president barack obama, champion of partial birth abortion. how sincere was rev. rodriguez when he raised the name of president donald trump in prayer at his inauguration? discomfited by the president’s use of an expression he has denied using, rev. rodriguez, a member of the “unofficial” evangelical advisory board and the president of the national hispanic christian leadership conference noted that “every single person is created in the image of god” and spoke of welcoming people equally from nigeria and norway, albeit after “a rigorous vetting process.” “later in the day, he said more: “in addition, and with great due deference, i believe that the comments attributed to our president can best be described as wrong, inappropriate, and hurtful. why? because when god looks at these nations, he sees his children.” (yahoo, jan. <NUM>, <NUM>)it should go without saying that our creator sees among “his children, millions of babies killed in their mother’s wombs. sadly, the pastor is not the only one who hypocritically regards the president’s alleged use of the ‘s’ word as more preach-worthy than the open advocation of abortion. isn’t it more than a tad hypocritical, if not downright sanctimonious that the vatican newspaper, l’osservatore romano would try a wash-his-mouth-with-soap stance on the latest alleged expletive of president donald trump? we all know by now that president trump’s alleged use of the ‘s’ word was tattle-taled to the internet world by catholic u.s. senator dick durbin, who went straight to the media to report the vulgarity had been “repeatedly” used at a white house meeting on immigration. tattletale dicky durbincontinued below... the newspaper, l’osservatore romano—the vatican’s flagship—gave trump’s comments about the immigration debate in the united states, front page attention, noting the comments had immediately sparked “controversy and indignation”. never mind that trump denies using the term. mercifully, the newspaper did not print the vulgar word that automatically spiralled the democrats into a full-on faux rage. no, none of that over here. but it’s not just vulgar expletives that rile people up. some words indiscriminately used to honor abortion advocates are just as—if not more—offensive to the faithful. some some pro-life catholics must have thought of the ‘s’ word when reading on twitter that abortion advocate lilianne ploumen, former minister for foreign trade and development cooperation in the netherlands, was recently honored by pope francis with the title of ‘commander in the pontifical equestrian order of st. gregory the great’. this was one tweet that turned out to be as troubling as it was true: “the lepanto institute was able to confirm from a december <NUM>, <NUM> dutch radio broadcast that ploumen indeed received the honor. in a brief video clip promoting the broadcast, ploumen displays the medal while saying that she received it from the pope. (lepanto institute, jan.<NUM>, <NUM>)“to say that lilianne ploumen is “pro-abortion” is an extreme understatement and doesn’t even come close to the scandalous reality of her activism. “in january of last year, after us president donald trump reinstated the mexico city policy, ploumen launched a new ngo called she decides to provide mass amounts of funds to organizations that would no longer receive funds from the us government. the mexico city policy automatically denies us funding for international organizations which perform or promote abortion. “referring to the mexico city policy as a “global gag rule,” ploumen stated that the intention of she decides was to continue support for existing programs being run by organizations such as the united nations population fund (unpfa), the international planned parenthood federation and marie stopes international. she said, “these are successful and effective programs: direct support, distributing condoms, making sure women are accompanied at the birth, and making sure abortion is safe if they have no other choice.” the lepanto institute continues their ploumen profile: “but ploumen’s anti-catholic activity isn’t restricted to abortion. in september of <NUM>, ploumen participated in the united nations lgbti core group. as the first speaker at the event, ploumen noted that “lgbti rights are human rights.” in her opening remarks, she said, “we cannot be complacent. [today] in more than <NUM> countries homosexuality is still criminalized…stigma against lgbt people continue all over the world.” “in <NUM>, ploumen ended foreign aid to the country of uganda for passing a bill banning sodomy and same-sex “marriage.” in february of <NUM>, ploumen called on lgbt activists to descend upon and disrupt mass at st. john the baptist cathedral, wearing pink triangles with the words “jesus excludes no one.” “the reason? she and other pro-lgbt activists were protesting the church’s moral teaching regarding homosexuality.”continued below... we already know how pope francis profiles president donald trump: “in <NUM>, in response to a question about then-candidate trump’s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall along the u.s. border with mexico, francis said a man with such views was “not christian”. (reuters, jan. <NUM>, <NUM>) “trump, who grew up in a presbyterian family, shot back saying it was “disgraceful” for the pope to question his faith.” actions speak so much louder than cuss words. thousands will be taking part in the <NUM> march for life today. neither rev. rodriguez nor pope francis will be there, but president trump will be, addressing the crowd by satellite.copyright © canada free pressrss feed for judi mcleodjudi mcleod is an award-winning journalist with <NUM> years’ experience in the print media. a former toronto sun columnist, she also worked for the kingston whig standard. her work has appeared on rush limbaugh, newsmax.com, drudge report, foxnews.com.older articles by judi mcleodplease adhere to our commenting policy to avoid being banned. as a privately owned website, we reserve the right to remove any comment and ban any user at any time.comments that contain spam, advertising, vulgarity, threats of violence, racism, anti-semitism, or personal or abusive attacks on other users may be removed and result in a ban.-- follow these instructions on registering",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,it’s not really president trump who needs his mouth washed out with soap,"judi mcleod, because without america, there is no free world.",,[''],,,<NUM>,<NUM>,beforeitsnews.com,fake,http://beforeitsnews.com/crime-all-stars/<NUM>/<NUM>/clinton-obama-emails-key-to-understanding-why-hillary-wasnt-indicted-andrew-mccarthy-<NUM>.html,"clinton–obama emails: key to understanding why hillary wasn’t indicted – andrew mccarthyheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!by andrew c. mccarthy / family security mattersnew fbi texts highlight a motive to conceal the president’s involvement.from the first, these columns have argued that the whitewash of the hillary clinton-emails caper was president barack obama’s call – not the fbi’s, and not the justice department’s. (see, e.g., here, here, and here.) the decision was inevitable. obama, using a pseudonymous email account, had repeatedly communicated with secretary clinton over her private, non-secure email account.these emails must have involved some classified information, given the nature of consultations between presidents and secretaries of state, the broad outlines of obama’s own executive order defining classified intelligence (see eo <NUM>, section <NUM>.<NUM>), and the fact that the obama administration adamantly refused to disclose the clinton-obama emails. if classified information was mishandled, it was necessarily mishandled on both ends of these email exchanges.if clinton had been charged, obama’s culpable involvement would have been patent. in any prosecution of clinton, the clinton-obama emails would have been in the spotlight. for the prosecution, they would be more proof of willful (or, if you prefer, grossly negligent) mishandling of intelligence. more significantly, for clinton’s defense, they would show that obama was complicit in clinton’s conduct yet faced no criminal charges.that is why such an indictment of hillary clinton was never going to happen. the latest jaw-dropping disclosures of text messages between fbi agent peter strzok and his paramour, fbi lawyer lisa page, illustrate this point.for the moment, i want to put aside the latest controversy – the fbi’s failure to retain five months of text messages between strzok and page, those chattiest of star-crossed lovers. yes, this “glitch” closes our window on a critical time in the trump-russia investigation: mid december <NUM> through mid may <NUM>. that is when the bureau and justice department were reportedly conducting and renewing (in <NUM>-day intervals) court-approved fisa surveillance that may well have focused on the newly sworn-in president of the united states. (remember: the bureau’s then-director, james comey, testified at a march <NUM> house intelligence committee hearing that the investigation was probing possible coordination with trump’s campaign and kremlin interference in the election.)the retention default has been chalked up to a technological mishap. assuming that this truly was an indiscriminate, bureau-wide problem – that lost texts are not limited to phones involved in the trump-russia investigation – it is hard to imagine its going undetected for five months in an agency whose business is information retention. but it is not inconceivable. attorney general jeff sessions maintains that an aggressive inquiry is underway, so let’s assume (for argument’s sake, at least) that either the texts will be recovered or a satisfactory explanation for their non-retention will be forthcoming.for now, let’s stick with the clinton-obama emails.only july <NUM>, <NUM>, comey held the press conference at which he delivered a statement describing mrs. clinton’s criminal conduct but nevertheless recommending against an indictment. we now know that comey’s remarks had been in the works for two months and were revised several times by the director and his advisers.this past weekend, in a letter to the fbi regarding the missing texts, senate homeland security committee chairman ron johnson (r., wis.) addressed some of these revisions. according to senator johnson, a draft dated june <NUM>, <NUM> (i.e., five days before comey delivered the final version), contained a passage expressly referring to a troublesome email exchange between clinton and obama. (i note that the fbi’s report of its eventual interview of clinton contains a cryptic reference to a july <NUM>, <NUM>, email that clinton sent from russia to obama’s email address. see report, page <NUM>.) the passage in the june <NUM> draft stated:we also assess that secretary clinton’s use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. she also used her personal email extensively while outside the united states, including from the territory of sophisticated adversaries. that use included an email exchange with the president while secretary clinton was on the territory of such an adversary. [emphasis added.] given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to secretary clinton’s personal email account.on the same day, according to a strzok-page text, a revised draft of comey’s remarks was circulated by his chief of staff, jim rybicki. it replaced “the president” with “another senior government official.”this effort to obscure obama’s involvement had an obvious flaw: it would practically have begged congressional investigators and enterprising journalists to press for the identification of the “senior government official” with whom clinton had exchanged emails. that was not going to work.consequently, by the time comey delivered his remarks on july <NUM>, the decision had been made to avoid even a veiled allusion to obama. instead, all the stress was placed on clinton (who was not going to be charged anyway) for irresponsibly sending and receiving sensitive emails that were likely to have been penetrated by hostile intelligence services. comey made no reference to clinton’s correspondent:we also assess that secretary clinton’s use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. she also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the united states, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. [emphasis added.] given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to secretary clinton’s personal e-mail account.the decision to purge any reference to obama is consistent with the panic that seized his administration from the moment clinton’s use of a private, non-secure server system was revealed in early march <NUM>. i detailed this reaction in a series of <NUM> columns (see, e.g., here and here). what most alarmed obama and clinton advisers (those groups overlap) was not only that there were several clinton-obama email exchanges, but also that obama dissembled about his knowledge of clinton’s private email use in a nationally televised interview.on march <NUM>, just after the new york times broke the news about clinton’s email practices at the state department, john podesta (a top obama adviser and clinton’s campaign chairman) emailed cheryl mills (clinton’s confidant and top aide in the obama state department) to suggest that clinton’s “emails to and from potus” should be “held” – i.e., not disclosed – because “that’s the heart of his exec privilege.” at the time, the house committee investigating the benghazi jihadist attack was pressing for production of clinton’s emails.as his counselors grappled with how to address his own involvement in clinton’s misconduct, obama deceptively told cbs news in a march <NUM> interview that he had found out about clinton’s use of personal email to conduct state department business “the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.” perhaps he was confident that, because he had used an alias in communicating with clinton, his emails to and from her – estimated to number around <NUM> – would remain undiscovered.his and clinton’s advisers were not so confident. right after the interview aired, clinton campaign secretary josh scherwin emailed jennifer palmieri and other senior campaign staffers, stating: “jen you probably have more on this but it looks like potus just said he found out hrc was using her personal email when he saw it on the news.”scherwin’s alert was forwarded to mills. shortly afterwards, an agitated mills emailed podesta: “we need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov.” (that is, obama had emails from clinton, which he had to know were from a private account since her address did not end in “@state.gov” as state department emails do.)so how did obama and his helpers “clean this up”?obama had his email communications with clinton sealed. he did this by invoking a dubious presidential-records privilege. the white house insisted that the matter had nothing to do with the contents of the emails, of course; rather, it was intended to vindicate the principle of confidentiality in presidential communications with close advisers. with the media content to play along, this had a twofold benefit: obama was able (<NUM>) to sidestep disclosure without acknowledging that the emails contained classified information and (<NUM>) to avoid using the term “executive privilege” – with all its dark watergate connotations – even though that was precisely what he was invoking.note that claims of executive privilege must yield to demands for disclosure of relevant evidence in criminal prosecutions. but of course, that’s not a problem if there will be no prosecution.the white house purported to repair the president’s disingenuous statement in the cbs interview by rationalizing that he had meant that he learned of clinton’s homebrew server system through news reports – he hadn’t meant to claim unawareness that she occasionally used private email. this was sheer misdirection: from obama’s standpoint, the problem was that he discussed government intelligence matters with the secretary of state through a private email account; the fact that, in addition, clinton’s private email account was connected to her own private server system, rather than some other private email service, was beside the point. but, again, the media was not interested in such distinctions and contentedly accepted the white house’s non-explanation.meanwhile, attorney general loretta lynch ordered comey to use the word “matter” rather than “investigation” to describe the fbi’s probe of clinton’s email practices. this ensured that the democratic administration’s law-enforcement agencies were aligning their story with the democratic candidate’s campaign rhetoric. if there was no investigation, there would be no prosecution.in april <NUM>, in another nationally televised interview, obama made clear that he did not want clinton to be indicted. his rationale was a legally frivolous straw man: clinton had not intended to harm national security. this was not an element of the felony offenses she had committed; nor was it in dispute. no matter: obama’s analysis was the stated view of the chief executive. if, as was sure to happen, his subordinates in the executive law-enforcement agencies conformed their decisions to his stated view, there would be no prosecution.within a few weeks, even though the investigation was ostensibly still underway and over a dozen key witnesses – including clinton herself – had not yet been interviewed, the fbi began drafting comey’s remarks that would close the investigation. there would be no prosecution.on june <NUM>, lynch met with clinton’s husband, former president bill clinton, on an out-of-the-way arizona tarmac, where their security details arranged for both their planes to be parked.over the next few days, the fbi took pains to strike any reference to obama’s emails with mrs. clinton from the statement in which comey would effectively end the “matter” with no prosecution.on july <NUM>, amid intense public criticism of her meeting with bill clinton, attorney general lynch piously announced that she would accept whatever recommendation the fbi director and career prosecutors made about charging clinton. as page told strzok in a text that day, “this is a purposeful leak following the airplane snafu.” it was also playacting. page elaborated that the attorney general already “knows no charges will be brought.” of course she did: it was understood by all involved that there would be no prosecution.knowing that, lynch had given the fbi notice on june <NUM> that she’d be announcing her intention to accept comey’s recommendation. fearing this just might look a bit choreographed, the fbi promptly amended comey’s planned remarks to include this assertion (which he in fact made on july <NUM>): “i have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the department of justice or any other part of the government. they do not know what i am about to say.”but they did not need to participate in drafting the statement, and they did not need to know the precise words he was going to use. it was not comey’s decision anyway. all they needed to know was that there would be no prosecution.on july <NUM>, with the decision that she would not be indicted long since made, mrs. clinton sat for an interview with the fbi – something she’d never have done if there were a chance she might be charged. the farce was complete with the justice department and fbi permitting two subjects of the investigation – mills and clinton aide heather samuelson – to sit in on the interview as lawyers representing clinton. that is not something law enforcement abides when it is serious about making a case. here, however, it was clear: there would be no prosecution.all cleaned up: no indictment, meaning no prosecution, meaning no disclosure of clinton-obama emails. it all worked like a charm . . . except the part where mrs. clinton wins the presidency and the problem is never spoken of again.a version of this piece also appeared on national review

journalism, pope saysheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!vatican city, jan <NUM>, <NUM> / <NUM>:<NUM> am (cna/ewtn news).- in his message for the world day of social communications, published wednesday, pope francis said that in a world of lightning-fast communication, there is a responsibility to combat falsehood and misinformation with truth, treating journalism as a people-oriented mission.“in today’s world, [the work of journalists] is, in every sense, not just a job; it is a mission,” the pope wrote in his message released jan. <NUM>.“amid feeding frenzies and the mad rush for a scoop, they must remember that the heart of information is not the speed with which it is reported or its audience impact, but persons.”“informing others means forming others; it means being in touch with people’s lives,” he continued. “that is why ensuring the accuracy of sources and protecting communication are real means of promoting goodness, generating trust, and opening the way to communion and peace.”francis’ message for the next world day of social communications was released jan. <NUM>, the feast day of st. francis de sales, the patron saint of journalists.the <NUM>nd annual celebration will take place may <NUM>, <NUM>, on the theme: “‘the truth will set you free’ (jn <NUM>:<NUM>). fake news and journalism for peace.”“in today’s fast-changing world of communications and digital systems, we are witnessing the spread of what has come to be known as ‘fake news,’” the pope said.“in this way, i would like to contribute to our shared commitment to stemming the spread of fake news and to rediscovering the dignity of journalism and the personal responsibility of journalists to communicate the truth.”the best “antidote” to the spread of falsehoods in ‘fake news’ aren’t strategies, he stated, but people.“people who are not greedy but ready to listen, people who make the effort to engage in sincere dialogue so that the truth can emerge; people who are attracted by goodness and take responsibility for how they use language.”everyone has the duty to counter the lies found in ‘fake news,’ he said. but an even weightier responsibility falls upon those whose job it is to provide the world with information, namely, journalists, the “protectors of news.”francis went on to encourage everyone to promote “a journalism of peace,” which he said doesn’t mean some saccharine or sentimental reporting that refuses to acknowledge the existence of real and serious problems.rather, he emphasized, a journalism of peace is journalism that is “truthful and opposed to falsehoods, rhetorical slogans, and sensational headlines. a journalism created by people for people, one that is at the service of all, especially those – and they are the majority in our world – who have no voice.”a journalism, he continued, that is less focused on breaking news, and more on exploring the underlying causes of conflicts, so that it can promote a deeper understanding and contribute to resolutions “by setting in place virtuous processes” and offering alternatives to “shouting matches.”the first ‘fake news,’ francis said, was that created by the “crafty serpent” in the book of genesis, who used falsehood to tempt eve into disobeying god.“the strategy of this skilled ‘father of lies’ (jn <NUM>:<NUM>) is precisely mimicry, that sly and dangerous form of seduction that worms its way into the heart with false and alluring arguments,” he said.eve’s temptation by the serpent “brings to light an essential element for our reflection: there is no such thing as harmless disinformation.”he pointed out how constant exposure to deceptive language can also have harmful consequences on our interior life, as illustrated by a quote from fyodor dostoevsky’s the brothers karamazov.“people who lie to themselves and listen to their own lie come to such a pass that they cannot distinguish the truth within them, or around them, and so lose all respect for themselves and for others. and having no respect, they cease to love, and in order to occupy and distract themselves without love they give way to passions and to coarse pleasures, and sink to bestiality in their vices, all from continual lying to others and to themselves.”so how do we defend ourselves from this evil, francis asked. “the most radical antidote to the virus of falsehood is purification by the truth,” which in christianity is more than just a judgment of things as true or false, he said.it’s also more than just revealing things that are concealed, he continued: “truth involves our whole life.”“truth is something you can lean on, so as not to fall,” he said. “in this relational sense, the only truly reliable and trustworthy one – the one on whom we can count – is the living god. hence, jesus can say: ‘i am the truth.’”“to this end, drawing inspiration from a franciscan prayer, we might turn to the truth in person,” he concluded, offering the following prayer:“lord, make us instruments of your peace.help us to recognize the evil latent in a communication that does not build communion.help us to remove the venom from our judgements.help us to speak about others as our brothers and sisters.you are faithful and trustworthy; may our words be seeds of goodness for the world:where there is shouting, let us practice listening;where there is confusion, let us inspire harmony;where there is ambiguity, let us bring clarity;where there is exclusion, let us offer solidarity;where there is sensationalism, let us use sobriety;where there is superficiality, let us raise real questions;where there is prejudice, let us awaken trust;where there is hostility, let us bring respect;where there is falsehood, let us bring truth.amen.”source:

to tolerate heretics within its realm. it hates president trump, strives to undermine israel, defames victor orban, seeks to bring poland to its knees--because of its striving for striving for sovereigntyneo-stalinism and the polish challengecourts have been turned into leverage for destruction of national democracies by the totalitarian system in late december, the european commission announced punitive measures against poland using the so-called “nuclear option”, article <NUM> of the lisbon treaty. the reason was the decision of warsaw to limit the power of judges. the eu considered this an infringement on “freedom, democracy and the rule of law”. in fact, the “nuclear option” of the eu has no relation to freedom, democracy, or the rule of law. its goal is to establish a totalitarian supranational system in poland, the leading country of the visegrad fronde, in order to supersede democratic national institutions of power.the judicial system in a democratic state should guard rights of citizens. together with the executive and legislative powers, it must guarantee “the enjoyment of life and liberty” of free citizens (the virginia declaration of rights of <NUM>), or according to jeremy bentham, the founder of british utilitarianism, ensure “the greatest happiness of the greatest number”. the problem is that judges have real and huge power. however unlike heads of states, governments and parliamentarians, they are not elected by anyone, which provides a solid ground for manipulation. today, the judicial system has turned into a disgusting parody of itself; supported by politicians, academia, media and ngos, it is now a powerful lever used by prominent people to promote the ideology of political correctness and multiculturalism. the goal of this ideology is ethnic and cultural substitution and, as a consequence, islamization. it is not actively displayed, although it is not concealed. in <NUM>, the former french interior minister jean-pierre chevenement called for integration of <NUM> million migrants from africa and asia within <NUM> years. in july <NUM>, the chief justice of england and wales lord phillips declared that it was inevitable to recognize sharia courts in great britain. in september <NUM>, at the peak of the crisis with migrants, the journalist ralf schuler (“bild”) reported the eu was planning to receive an additional <NUM> million refugees from asia and africa.in september <NUM>, the eu financed the exhibition in brussels called “islam, it’s also our history!”. according to isabelle benoit, a historian from the tempora organization, “we want to make it clear to europeans that islam is a part of our civilization”. on february <NUM>, president of france emmanuel macron said: “french culture does not exist. there is a culture in france and it is diverse… french art? i have never seen it!”. according to finance minister of germany wolfgang sch√§uble, germans need to learn humanistic values of islam, and islam is “a constituent part of germany”. this aim is realized in three stages. stage one - corruption of society, imposition of barbarous archaic customs, destruction of the national culture, eradication of judeo-christian values. stage two - support of islamic occupation and migrant violence, legalization of the sharia. stage three - suppression of dissent at all levels. it is obvious that a healthy and cohesive society would resist turning it into slavery. therefore it is necessary to undermine its foundations, to swap values: virtue should be presented as evil, barbarity - as cultural originality, abnormality - as the norm. courts are the main leverage in this game. below are some of the examples of this phenomenon. in may <NUM>, a british court decided to grant political asylum to <NUM>-year-old kenyan john thuo. thuo, the leader of the murderous mungiki sect, personally butchered <NUM> of his compatriots with a machete and took part in a disgusting female genital mutilation ritual. in <NUM>, a party called “charity, freedom and diversity,” which advocates legalization of pedophilia, all kinds of drugs, bestiality and child pornography, was registered in netherlands.continued below... in august <NUM>, the swedish court set free sture bergwall - the sadist and cannibal who confessed that he had raped, tortured, and eaten his victims. in february <NUM>, a german court released the former member of the red army faction (raf) brigitte mohnhaupt, who had murdered <NUM> people in the <NUM>s. she didn’t express any regret about her crimes. in july <NUM>, the national health service (nhs) reported <NUM>,<NUM> cases of female genital mutilations. although this disgusting procedure was banned in the uk in <NUM>, not a single person was convicted. this is only a marginal part of thousands of similar verdicts, which under the guise of humanism and human rights impose chaos and all kinds of perversions. on the other hand, christian values are also being consistently destroyed. the french court ordered the removal of the cross from the statue of pope saint john paul ii in plo√´rmel, because it violated the law imposing a strict separation of church and state. in august <NUM>, dutch prosecutors found nothing illegal in filming a porn movie in a church confessional. in january <NUM>, the british high court decided, that the right of homosexuals to equality “should take precedence” over the right of christians to manifest their beliefs and moral values. (the telegraph). when the foundation of the society is undermined, the second stage of destruction begins. in the rule of law, laws should be applied to all citizens - otherwise the very idea of democracy and justice loses its meaning. today, parallel sharia law legally operates in western europe. the so called laws of the jungle reign in “black holes” of “no-go-zones”, and courts condone lawlessness and savagery.during the period of <NUM> to <NUM>, two teenage girls from fontenay-sous-bois (outside paris) were gang-raped by <NUM> muslim teenagers. ten of them were acquitted, two persons were sentenced to only one year in prison, one person was sentenced to six months in prison, and the last one out of <NUM> was given a suspended sentence. in january <NUM>, a french jew, ilan halimi, was kidnapped by a gang calling themselves “barbarians,” headed by yusuf fofana. they tortured him, doused him with gasoline and burned him alive. <NUM> members of the gang were sentenced to terms between <NUM> months to <NUM> years only. two “barbarians” were freed. in may <NUM>, at the school of lund (sweden) a muslim migrant teen raped a <NUM>-year-old girl. the girl was transferred, but the rapist remained at the same school. he was only punished with <NUM> hours of detention. in october <NUM>, the gothenburg district court sentenced a migrant abdul to <NUM> months of youth care (only!) for raping of a <NUM>-year-old girl, but the supreme court of western sweden abrogated abdul because he suffered from adhd syndrome and didn’t understand “no”. in july <NUM>, malm√∂ district court sentenced a <NUM>-year-old afghan muslim migrant to one month in prison for raping a <NUM>-year-old boy. and so on. according to official statistics, only every fifth migrant rapist in sweden (and only <NUM> percent of migrant pedophiles) are deported to their home countries - afghanistan, pakistan, somalia or iraq. this is not characteristic of sweden in particular. in december <NUM> in vienna, <NUM>-year-old amir from iraq raped a <NUM>-year-old boy in a toilet of a swimming pool. the district court sentenced him to six years, but the austrian supreme court overturned it “for lack of evidence.” in december <NUM>, the british high court concluded that abdul-hakim belhaj, the ex-leader of an islamist group that fought the gaddafi regime, had a “well-founded claim” against the former head of counter-terrorism at mi<NUM>, mark allen.continued below... pakistani members of the rochdale child sex abuse ring (with the exception of their leader shabir ahmed) were sentenced to ridiculous terms from <NUM> to <NUM> years. in <NUM>, a <NUM>-year-old preacher suleman maknojioa was accused of harassing an <NUM>-year-old girl. he was sentenced to <NUM> weeks’ imprisonment only, but did not stay in prison a single day as he was his family’s only breadwinner. in germany in january <NUM>, a <NUM>-year-old syrian migrant was sentenced to one year and <NUM> months of imprisonment only for raping a mentally disabled woman—“because when he is drunk, he is unpredictable”. by that time he committed <NUM> various offenses, including assault, robbery and fare evasion. in march, a migrant with a machete attacked an <NUM>-year-old man in d√ºsseldorf and remained free. in hamburg, <NUM> people were injured when two migrants used tear gas on a train. they remained free too. at dresden-zschachwitz station, two asylum seekers from morocco and libya pushed a <NUM>-year-old man onto the tracks of an oncoming train. he miraculously survived. the chief prosecutor dropped charges against them. there are hundreds of similar examples… in june this year, three underage muslim migrants severely raped a <NUM>-year-old girl in idaho. in the court room their lawyers advocated that the so called “boys” were decent and trustworthy and they suffered from post traumatic stress (ptsd). in april <NUM>, for the sake of “freedom of expression” the spanish supreme court freed <NUM> islamists who were planning terrorist attacks in the name of the “liberation of spain”. the western legal system openly sabotages decisions of the executive and legislative branches of power. the best evidence of this is courts blocking trump’s ban on the reception of migrants from the middle east. this has nothing to do with humanism, since those who need help most of all, are deprived of it. it’s not only about christians and yezidis. in september <NUM>, britain denied refuge to <NUM>-year-old nneka obazee - a nigerian lesbian woman and her stepchild, although she was doomed to a death penalty in her home country. after this happened, the poor woman tried to commit a suicide. in israel, the high court of justice deliberately replaces the executive branch: it prevents destruction of houses of terrorists and deportation of terrorists, cooperates with leftist ngos to demolish jewish houses, and blocks the deportation of illegal african migrants to third world countries. eu laws literally ensure safety for terrorists. imam abdelbaki es satty, who organized a terrorist attack in barcelona, was brought to trial on drug related charges in <NUM>, but judge pablo de la rubia dismissed his deportation, as it was deemed a violation of eu laws. in august <NUM>, two al-qaeda terrorists, one of whom plotted to kill thousands of people in a bomb attack in a british shopping center, applied to the european court of human rights against mi<NUM>. officials at the european court allowed their application to go ahead. the european court of human rights and the british court of appeal didn’t deport abu qatad, palestinian al-qaeda activist, to the hashemite kingdom for <NUM> years because of “humanitarian considerations.” the third stage is the elimination of dissenters of any age and social status. stalin asserted that repression should be based on laws, and indeed stalin’s terror was based on the progressive stalinist constitution of <NUM>. the legislation of western countries, which is quite liberal, opens limitless possibilities for justice. the french pioneered the path to muslim colonization. the starting point on the way to ethnic and cultural substitution, according to eric zemmur, was the pleven law on racism (<NUM>), which was then supplemented with even more radical laws. germany went even further by deciding to set censorship - fines of up to $<NUM>,<NUM>,<NUM> for “hate speech”—in order to protect freedom of speech, according to ex-justice minister heiko maas. the last major and successful case was the deprivation of the parliamentary immunity of marin le pen by the french prosecutor’s office after she published images of isis atrocities on twitter. the swedish prosecutor’s office accused peter springare, a police officer from orebro, of spreading hatred and racism. all he did was list police reports compiled in one week and naming criminals and countries of their origin. aboriginals are defenseless in the face of their colonial barbarians, because the judicial system sides with the latter always and everywhere. a mere suspicion of islamophobia can cause fatal consequences. in august <NUM>, a <NUM>-year-old man from stockholm was hit with a <NUM> kroner fine for eating a bacon sandwich in front of three muslim women wearing headscarves. in may <NUM>, a <NUM>-year-old swedish woman from dalarna was prosecuted for inciting hatred. she did not like that muslim teenagers “set fire to cars, urinated and defecated on the streets”. in <NUM>, <NUM>-year-old kevin crehan made a joke by leaving a half-eaten sandwich with bacon on the doorstep of a mosque in bristol. he was accused of racist attack, sentenced to one year in prison and died there under strange circumstances. any doubt on the purity of islam is ruthlessly punished. in august <NUM>, the german journalist michael st√ºrzenberger was sentenced to a half-year in prison after posting a photo on facebook where a ranking nazi was shaking hands with amin al-husseini—the grand mufti of jerusalem. no totalitarian system is ready to tolerate heretics within its realm. that’s why it hates president trump so much. that’s why it strives to undermine israel, defames victor orban and seeks to bring poland to its knees—because of its striving for sovereignty and national democracy. alexander maistrovoy is the author of “agony of hercules or a farewell to democracy (notes

stars around in this globular clusterheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!astronomers have been fascinated with globular clusters ever since they were first observed in <NUM>th century. these spherical collections of stars are among the oldest known stellar systems in the universe, dating back to the early universe when galaxies were just beginning to grow and evolve. such clusters orbit the centers of most galaxies, with over <NUM> known to belong to the milky way alone.one of these clusters is known as ngc <NUM>, a cluster located about <NUM>,<NUM> light years away in the southern constellation of vela. using the eso’s very large telescope (vlt) at the paranal observatory in chile, a team of astronomers recently studied this cluster and noticed something very interesting. according to the study they released, this cluster appears to have a black hole embedded in it.the study appeared in the monthly notices of the royal astronomical society under the title “a detached stellar-mass black hole candidate in the globular cluster ngc <NUM>“. the study was led by benjamin giesers of the georg-august-university of göttingen and included members from liverpool john moores university, queen mary university of london, the leiden observatory, the institute of astrophysics and space sciences, eth zurich, and the leibniz institute for astrophysics potsdam (aip).for the sake of their study, the team relied on the multi unit spectroscopic explorer (muse) instrument on the vlt to observe ngc <NUM>. this instrument is unique because of the way it allows astronomers to measure the motions of thousands of far away stars simultaneously. in the course of their observations, the team found that one of the cluster’s stars was being flung around at speeds of several hundred kilometers an hour and with a period of <NUM> days.as giesers explained in an eso press release:“it was orbiting something that was completely invisible, which had a mass more than four times the sun — this could only be a black hole! the first one found in a globular cluster by directly observing its gravitational pull.”this finding was rather unexpected, and constitutes the first time that astronomers have been able to detect an inactive black hole at the heart of a globular cluster – meaning that it is not currently accreting matter or surrounded by a glowing disc of gas. they were also able to estimate the black hole’s mass by measuring the movements of the star around it and thus extrapolating its enormous gravitational pull.from its observed properties, the team determined that the rapidly-moving star is about <NUM>.<NUM> times the mass of our sun and the mass of its black hole counterpart to be around <NUM>.<NUM> times the sun’s mass. this put’s it in the “stellar-mass black hole” category, which are stars that exceeds the maximum mass allowance of a neutron star, but are smaller than supermassive black holes (smbhs) – which exist at the centers of most galaxies.this finding is highly significant, and not just because it was the first time that astronomers have observed a stellar-mass black hole in a globular cluster. in addition, it confirms what scientists have been suspecting for a few years now, thanks to recent radio and x-ray studies of globular clusters and the detection of gravity wave signals. basically, it indicates that black holes are more common in globular clusters than previously thought.“until recently, it was assumed that almost all black holes would disappear from globular clusters after a short time and that systems like this should not even exist!” said giesers. “but clearly this is not the case – our discovery is the first direct detection of the gravitational effects of a stellar-mass black hole in a globular cluster. this finding helps in understanding the formation of globular clusters and the evolution of black holes and binary systems – vital in the context of understanding gravitational wave sources.”this find was also significant given that the relationship between black holes and globular clusters remains a mysterious, but highly important one. due to their high masses, compact volumes, and great ages, astronomers believe that clusters have produced a large number of stellar-mass black holes over the course of the universe’s history. this discovery could therefore tell us much about the formation of globular clusters, black holes, and the origins of gravitational wave events.and be sure to enjoy this eso podcast explaining the recent discovery:further reading: eso, mnrasthe post a black hole is pushing the stars around in this globular cluster appeared first on universe today.source:

incidentsheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!by stephen bryen / american thinkerterrorists, whether domestic or foreign, organization-based or truly lone wolf and unconnected, all have important advantages favoring the success of their attacks: they can exploit the multiple vulnerabilities that exist in civil society (notwithstanding whether the terrorists operate in democratic or authoritarian states), and time is on their side.terrorists exploit shock and time.there is not much that can be done to remove shock from the equation. a terrorist with a gun, a bomb, a knife or a truck can wreak a lot of havoc. shock can paralyze potential victims and make it hard for law enforcement to go after the perpetrator.in israel, practically every adult has military training, and many israelis are armed. while successful attacks have occurred (bombings, shootings, vehicle attacks, and knifings, to name some), the advantage israel generally has is rapid reaction based on the simple fact that armed citizens know what to do when a terrorist attacks.most of the rest of the world is different. a police presence can help, but even then, in certain scenarios terrorists can be effective. security guards can also help, but very often they are the first target of an intruder in a building or facility. in june <NUM>, a white supremacist <NUM>-year-old james wenneker von brunn entered the holocaust museum in washington, dc with a rifle and killed museum special police officer stephen tyrone johns. other guards shot at von brunn, who was wounded and apprehended.a very important component in terrorist incidents is how long it takes for law enforcement to react and to neutralize the attacker. in las vegas from the time <NUM> was sounded to the swat team destroyed the hotel room door where the shooter was took <NUM> minutes. this gave the shooter ample time to use his ten guns, even reloading some of them while killing <NUM> people and wounding some <NUM> others.las vegas has well-trained swat teams. why then did it take <NUM> minutes?the same question can be asked in countless other examples, whether the bataclan night club in paris, the <NUM> nord-ost siege in the dubrovka theater in moscow, the virginia tech massacre in <NUM>, the washington navy yard attack in the navsea building in september <NUM>, the <NUM> san bernardino shooting, or the pulse nightclub shooting in june, <NUM>.in almost every case the problem amounted to a “time” problem.the time problem consists of the following issues: (a) trying to locate a shooter and (b) attempting to reach the shooter and neutralize him (or her).even with current security systems, it is not easy to locate a shooter. the reasons for this are the lack of proper coverage by cameras and sensors leading to many blind spots, the inability to interpret surveillance images when they are available, the fact that a shooter may be moving around (although it would seem in the las vegas case, from what we know now, that the shooter operated from a hotel room and smashed out windows so he could fire on the country music festival).most security systems in the united states, and elsewhere in the world, were designed <NUM> or more years ago. while some improvements have been made (wifi digital cameras replacing old analog cameras), overall the nature of these systems has not changed much. what they offer are “pictures” from different cameras that are flashed across a computer screen or a tv monitor. someone in a command center is supposed to watch these pictures and sound an alarm if something happens and if they “see” it. this type of security “system” primarily is valuable for collecting forensic information after an incident or suspect intrusion. there the video feed can be examined. even in london, one of the most wired-up cities in the world, it takes police anywhere from hours to days to make use of surveillance camera video footage as an aid to apprehending a terrorist. obviously, that is helpful, but it would be better if the camera feed could be accessed in a more direct fashion.an israeli inventor who was the lead manager for installing security systems in <NUM> sensitive israeli villages and who also built a security system for a prison along the egyptian border (to keep terrorists out, not just to keep prisoners in), saw this weakness in current security systems and set out to fix the problem. his name is eran jedwab and his product is called jedeye. it is the first system to bolt onto traditional security systems and provide security guards and police with real-time situational awareness of a threat including full visualization of a facility or campus. the system is now being installed at locations in the united states.other technologies also could be very useful, but promoting them has been a “hard sell” in the united states. one of them is gunshot detectors. gunshot detectors can actually locate a shooter in a millisecond, can aim cameras in the shooter’s location and can even be slaved to sniper rifles in the hands of law enforcement. while gunshot detectors in the past are fixed in place, today mobile gunshot detectors can be mounted on police vehicles. there are a few companies that offer such products including shotspotter in newark, california and safety dynamics in tucson, arizona. had a mobile gunshot detector been in las vegas, the shooter would have been accurately located immediately.it would help a great deal if the department of homeland security (dhs) was more proactive in sponsoring and testing new technology aimed at reducing the time it takes to neutralize an active shooter or an intruder. while dhs (through the tsa) has spent heavily on airport passenger and baggage security systems, much of the rest has been underfunded or neglected. now is the time for dhs, supported by the congress, to go into high gear in sponsoring solutions that reduce the time it takes to stop a terrorist.http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/<NUM>/<NUM>/the_time_factor_and_active_shooter_incidents.html#ixzz<NUM>uzctrve<NUM>read more great articles here:

officials are on high alert amid fears that north korea is planning it’s biggest ever missile test to coincide with president donald trump’s visit to south korea tuesday. foreign policy analysts say if north korea goes through with a launch during the president’s visit, u.s. military retaliation is assured.reports of likely provocation from north korea come after an extended period of relative silence from north korean dictator kim jong-un following a sept. <NUM> launch. but a launch test while trump is visiting the korean peninsula, which is currently surrounded by u.s. battleships and soldiers, would be the hermit kingdom’s biggest show of belligerence yet.to the dismay of some diplomacy experts, the president has made no secret that he views north korea as an international menace which he wants to deal with militarily should the opportunity present. trump has in recent months ratcheted up rhetoric against north korea, calling jong-un “rocket man” earlier this year and classifying the country’s quest to become a world nuclear power a “suicide mission.” in august, the president vowed that any north korean actions which endanger american lives will be met with “fire and fury.”on monday, trump met with japanese prime minister shinzo abe to discuss the sale of u.s. military equipment the president said will help bolster international protection agains north korean aggression. abe, trump said after the meeting has agreed “to purchase massive amounts of military equipment” that could be used to shoot down long range missiles fired in the region.also on monday, south korean officials announced new economic sanctions against <NUM> north koreans with ties to the country’s nuclear program.as reuters reported:all <NUM> individuals on which the south korean sanctions were imposed were directly affiliated to north korean banks, according to an official government announcement by the finance minister uploaded on the interior ministry’s website. “they are all people at north korean financial institutions that have already been sanctioned by the united nations,” a government official directly involved in the sanction development process told reuters. the official asked for anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media. “they’re high-ranking employees who have been linked to north korea’s nuclear and missile development program as well as the north’s foreign exchange procurement efforts.”the move is seen by many international watchers as likely to bolster north korea’s desire to send a message with a missile launch during trump’s visit.if such a launch does occur while trump is in south korea, the president’s proximity to the danger could play a huge mental role in any future decisions he makes about u.s. military maneuvers in the region. during recent north korean missile experiments, the sound of air raid sirens blaring in nations throughout the pacific has become a frequent reminder of the growing nuclear threat.should trump decide u.s. military intervention is warranted in the region, the u.s. military-industrial complex is certainly ready to react. last week, the pentagon briefed lawmakers on the military’s most likely course of action, including a note that u.s. ground forces would be needed in the country to secure north korean nuclear sites following an attack.the post prepare for war: as trump tours asia,

means would involve sanctions against multiple nations, and a war with both russia & china. their value together is formidable in halting the financial battles from becoming a global war. the united states prefers to invade and destroy indefensible nations like libya, iraq, ukraine, syria, and by proxy yemen. the usmilitary appears formidable against undeveloped nations, seeking to destroy their infra-structure and their entire economies, in pursuit of the common langley theme of destabilization. in the process, the usmilitary since the korean war has killed <NUM> million civilians, a figure receiving increased publicity. the eastern nations and the opponents to us financial hegemony will not tolerate the abuse any longer. they have been organizing on a massive scale in the last several years. ironically, the absent stability can be seen in the united states after coming full circle. the deep division of good versus evil, of honest versus corrupt, of renewed development versus

usgovt as a smokescreen for global narcotics monopoly and tighter control of usd movements. then later, following the lehman failure (killjob by jpmorgan and goldman sachs) and the installation of the zero interest rate policy and quantitative easing as fixed monetary policies, the community of nations has been objecting fiercely. the zero bound on rates greatly distorted all asset valuations and financial markets. the hyper monetary inflation works to destroy capital in recognized steps. these (zirp & qe) are last ditch desperation policies designed to enable much larger liquidity for the insolvent banking structures. without them, the big us banks would suffer failure. they also provide cover for the amplified relief efforts directed at the multi-$trillion derivative mountain. in no

ones.beware of mammoth legislation that expands the government’s powers at the citizenry’s expense. rushed through congress a mere <NUM> days after the <NUM>/<NUM> attacks, the usa patriot act drove a stake through the heart of the bill of rights, undermined civil liberties, expanded the government’s powers and opened the door to far-reaching surveillance by the government on american citizens.pre-emptive strikes will only lead to further blowback. not content to wage war against afghanistan, which served as the base for osama bin laden, the u.s. embarked on a pre-emptive war against iraq in order to “stop any adversary challenging america’s military superiority and adopt a strike-first policy against terrorist threats ‘before they're fully formed.’” we are still suffering the consequences of this failed policy, which has resulted in lives lost, taxpayer dollars wasted, the fomenting of hatred against the u.s. and the further radicalization of terrorist cells.war is costly. there are many reasons to go to war, but those who have advocated that the u.s. remain at war, year after year, are the very entities that have profited most from these endless military occupations and exercises. thus far, the u.s. taxpayer has been made to shell out more than $<NUM>.<NUM> trillion on “military operations, the training of security forces in afghanistan and iraq, weapons maintenance, base support, reconstruction, embassy maintenance, foreign aid, and veterans’ medical care, as well as war-related intelligence operations not tracked by the pentagon” since <NUM>. other estimates that account for war-related spending, veterans’ benefits and various promissory notes place that figure closer to $<NUM>.<NUM> trillion. that also does not include the more than <NUM>,<NUM> civilians killed so far, or the <NUM>.<NUM> million refugees displaced from their homes as a result of the endless drone strikes and violence.advocating torture makes you no better than terrorists. the horrors that took place at abu ghraib, the american-run prison in iraq, continue to shock those with any decency. photographs leaked to the media depicted “us military personnel humiliating, hurting and abusing iraqi prisoners in a myriad of perverse ways. while american servicemen and women smiled and gave thumbs up, naked men were threatened by dogs, or were hooded, forced into sexual positions, placed standing with wires attached to their bodies, or left bleeding on prison floors.” adding to the descent into moral depravity, the united states government legalized the use of torture, including waterboarding, in violation of international law and continues to sanction human rights violations in the pursuit of national security. the ramifications have been far-reaching, with local police now employing similar torture tactics at secret locations such as homan square in chicago.allowing the government to spy on the citizenry will not reduce acts of terrorism, but it will result in a watched, submissive, surveillance society. a byproduct of this post <NUM>/<NUM>-age in which we live, whether you’re walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the nsa or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. this doesn’t even begin to touch on the corporate trackers such as google that monitor your purchases, web browsing, facebook posts and other activities taking place in the cyber sphere. we are all becoming data collected in government files. the chilling effect of this endless surveillance is a more anxious and submissive citizenry.don’t become so distracted by the news cycle that you lose sight of what the government is doing. the average american has a hard time keeping up with and remembering all of the “events,” manufactured or otherwise, which occur like clockwork and keep us distracted, deluded, amused, and insulated from the reality of the american police state. whether these events are critical or unimportant, when we’re being bombarded with wall-to-wall news coverage and news cycles that change every few days, it’s difficult to stay focused on one thing—namely, holding the government accountable to abiding by the rule of law—and the powers-that-be understand this. in this way, regularly scheduled trivia and/or distractions that keep the citizenry tuned into the various breaking news headlines and entertainment spectacles also keep them tuned out to the government’s steady encroachments on their freedoms.if you stop holding the government accountable to the rule of law, the only laws it abides by will be the ones used to clamp down on the citizenry. having failed to hold government officials accountable to abiding by the rule of law, the american people have found themselves saddled with a government that skirts, flouts and violates the constitution with little consequence. overcriminalization, asset forfeiture schemes, police brutality, profit-driven prisons, warrantless surveillance, swat team raids, indefinite detentions, covert agencies, and secret courts are just a few of the egregious practices carried out by a government that operates beyond the reach of the law.do not turn your country into a battlefield, your citizens into enemy combatants, and your law enforcement officers into extensions of the military. a standing army—something that propelled the early colonists into revolution—strips the citizenry of any vestige of freedom. how can there be any semblance of freedom when there are tanks in the streets, military encampments in cities, blackhawk helicopters and armed drones patrolling overhead? it was for this reason that those who established america vested control of the military in a civilian government, with a civilian commander-in-chief. they did not want a military government, ruled by force. rather, they opted for a republic bound by the rule of law: the u.s. constitution. unfortunately, we in america now find ourselves struggling to retain some semblance of freedom in the face of police and law enforcement agencies that look and act like the military and have just as little regard for the fourth amendment, laws such as the ndaa that allow the military to arrest and indefinitely detain american citizens, and military drills that acclimate the american people to the sight of armored tanks in the streets, military encampments in cities, and combat aircraft patrolling overhead.as long as you remain fearful and distrustful of each other, you will be incapable of standing united against any threats posed by a power-hungry government. early on, u.s. officials solved the problem of how to implement their authoritarian policies without incurring a citizen uprising: fear. the powers-that-be want us to feel threatened by forces beyond our control (terrorists, shooters, bombers). they want us afraid and dependent on the government and its militarized armies for our safety and well-being. most of all, they want us distrustful of each other, divided by our prejudices, and at each other’s throats.if you trade your freedom for security, the terrorists win. we’ve walked a strange and harrowing road since september <NUM>, <NUM>, littered with the debris of our once-vaunted liberties. we have gone from a nation that took great pride in being a model of a representative democracy to being a model of how to persuade a freedom-loving people to march in lockstep with a police state. and in so doing, we have proven osama bin laden right. he warned that “freedom and human rights in america are doomed. the u.s. government will lead the american people in — and the west in general — into an unbearable hell and a choking life.”to sum things up, the destruction that began with the <NUM>/<NUM> terror attacks has expanded into an all-out campaign of terror, trauma, acclimation and indoctrination aimed at getting americans used to life in the american police state. the bogeyman’s names and faces change over time, but the end result remains the same: our unquestioning acquiescence to anything the government wants to do in exchange for the phantom promise of safety and security has transitioned us to life in a society where government agents routinely practice violence on the citizens while, in conjunction with the corporate state, spying on the most intimate details of our personal lives.the lesson learned, as i document in my book

message in print, but it is the acid test of knowledge to orate and debate those thoughts in front of an informed and skeptical audience. highlight of this author’s week was being honored as guest speaker at my local rotary club. “service above self” is the motto of this oldest of all service organizations, and they have the record of good deeds to support their claim.my luncheon oratory included information on the global warming issue and the difficulty in presenting information to the public. the latter made far worse by a news media that has ceased to be free. i stated the problem was scientifically illiterate news directors and high school educated talk radio hosts with over developed thumbs on the caller dump button. this statement requires clarification.just one generation ago, the term ‘high school education’ would not have been considered demeaning. one generation ago american primary and secondary education tested and ranked number one in the world. what had been the gold standard in knowledge has been quickly substituted with a federal certificate of decline in excellence.every child left behindthe typical result of every government involvement in the last generation is the outcome based goal which raises none, it merely lowers the common denominator. poorly educated students go on to become poor quality workers who make poor life choices. this spiral of stupidity quickly leads to consumption over productivity, speculation over thrift. we may soon have empirical data on how long a nation can endure imposed ignorance.in the global warming discussion i displayed two graphs available at ‘ice age chart’ in any search engine. i neglected to mention that there are many conflicting charts at that website with no disclaimers. on display were two charts showing earth temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels across one half billion and one half million year time scales. readily apparent, regardless of education level, is that there is no correlation between temperature and co<NUM>.formal education should only be beginning and never a limit on personal knowledge. we live in an age when the world’s greatest library is a website away, the world’s greatest librarian just a search engine click away. but this great resource comes with the ‘caveat emptor’ or ‘buyer beware’. lurking in the internet shadows are those who would beat you senseless with a senseless mann hockey stick graph.in researching the obvious climate fraud, the heavy hand of government interventions is everywhere. what the department of education had begun in dumb down primary education, the national science foundation and the national academy of science have completed at the collegiate level.manipulation of climate science is readily apparent. also apparent is the geo-nuclear heat and mineral flow thru the oceans as a factor in climate. it is disturbing to find every web listing on ocean currents, temperatures and chemistry has the odious goreian climate statement that human produced co<NUM> is destroying the ocean balance.the same day as the rotary presentation, the october issue of my favorite punching bag, the rolling stone arrived. in the spirit of “service above self”, here’s a quick review so you don’t have to suffer on your own. cover articles “obama fights back” interview and the matt taibbi article “the truth about the tea party” are the most relevant.the oval office interview, by jann wenner appears highly scripted. no doubt pre-submitted questions and if not a pre-printed reply, then wenner must have missed the teleprompter hanging behind his back. the chief executive did mention ‘we’ several times by necessity, but quickly reverted to the “i did everything” position of a true narcissist.the standard talking points were that tea party rubes are under unwitting control of dick armey and freedom works. tea party members are ‘anti-immigrant’ and ‘opposed by what i represent as president’ [they’re racist] and opposed to green energy and work place safety regulations.obama continues, ‘look, as president, i swore to uphold the constitution, and part of that constitution is a free press’, although the fox news viewpoint is ‘destructive for the country’. rather than admit ‘truth’ has a bearing on media success, viewpoints are just a marketing tool. meanwhile our fearless leader ‘had to prevent a great depression, restore the financial system, manage two wars’…liberate health care from doctors and student loans and health insurance from the private sector.he’s achieved <NUM>% of his goals in <NUM>% of his first term and public option, additional taxes and greater control of everything is enabled and awaiting regulatory enforcement. another barack goal was a white house basketball goal, now erected on the existing tennis court. a half page photo shows our leader shooting hoops with the washington monument in the background.while not busy slam dunking domestic issues this savant has ‘reset our relations with russia’, brought peace to the middle east, ended the iraq war and restored america’s leadership on issues like human rights and torture world-wide. he can do all this while listening to the <NUM> songs he has loaded into his ipod.mr pres agrees with nasa wack-job james hanson, that climate change is comparable to slavery faced by lincoln and nazism faced by churchill. his nut-case energy secretary, steven chu has claimed painting all roofs and highways white would provide a temporary solution to global warming. surprising, chu was the ‘unsung hero of the gulf oil spill…this guy went down and helped design the way to plug that hole with bp engineers’. finally credit for everything is given to this administration.the subject of command performances came up with bob dylan skipping all of the expected idolatry, singing “the times they are a changing”, dissing the photo-ops and leaving. the opposite occurred at the sir paul mccartney concert. discussing this beatle singing ‘michelle’ to barack’s michelle sends a sobbing president from the room.the matt taibbi article “tea & crackers” had some surprising areas of agreement. “this is america and we have an entrenched oligarchical system in place that insulates us from the any meaningful political change”. matt goes on to detail the compromising of tea party issues and candidates by the gop insiders, a very real problem for all true patriots.matt mentions kentucky senate candidate rand paul and possible emerging conflicts and then mentions rand’s dad, rep ron paul and <NUM> fringe candidate for president. matt confesses that while covering the paul campaign, he liked ron because “he’s honest, anti-war and pro-legalization”. it is shocking to see a liberal reporter agree with so many libertarian positions. maybe matt is a patriot in the closet.the four way testevery rotary meeting begins with a prayer, the pledge of allegiance, reciting the four way test and singing a song. our song that day was “god bless america”. there were sixty members from a wide range of ages, backgrounds and ethnicities, though none of that mattered. to me they were neighbors i’d never met, principled and dedicated to doing the right thing.founded in <NUM>, the rotary club has been doing the right thing for a long time. they have <NUM>.<NUM> million members in <NUM>,<NUM> chapters on six continents. their mission statement is to “combat hunger, improve health and sanitation, provide education and job training, promote peace and eradicate polio”. their “ambassadorial scholarship” program has enabled <NUM>,<NUM> students from <NUM> countries to live for one year with a foreign family.while promoting a functional mass transit system in the early nineties i was guest speaker for fifty rotary meetings at thirty different chapters. if there is a better path to truth and understanding than the rotarians, then i’m not aware of it. it is certainly not articulated or practiced by either political party or the government bureaucracy. rotary international is not a political organization and i am neither a member nor a spokesman. as just a speaker and honored guest i can state, you have no finer neighbors than these dedicated volunteer servants.there is urgent need for political reform to save america and that reform cannot be modeled on either of the existing corrupt parties. the rotary, lions, optimist, kiwanis and other service clubs are connected to the unpoisoned roots of america. i look forward to the day when all of america can embrace their spirit of service. that day when former democrats, former republicans and former libertarians can stand shoulder to shoulder and sing “god bless america”.",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE>

beach recede into a misty horizon. look north two miles and there, perched high on a bluff, is the beautiful heceta head lighthouse, the most photographed and arguably most beautiful lighthouse on the oregon coast, though i’m not sure how that’s measured. then step in the elevator and plunge <NUM> feet down into the bowels of mother earth for the experience of a lifetime. really. for a reasonable price of admission you’ll be treated to the world’s largest sea cave. it’s not a gimmick or a circus trick, just nature hard at work carving out basalt rock one salty wave at a time. and yes, those are sea lions down there lounging about, rubbing blubber, yelping and multiplying, and stinking up the place.on a clear day the view from the headlands at the sea lions cave visitors center is outstanding. but step too close to the edge and you’ll get the woozies, maybe the wobblies, as you gaze down at fields of wavy green grass that plunge <NUM> feet to the blue pacific churning and sloshing back-and-forth in a perpetual rolling ballet.although my photos are long gone, i remember my first encounter with the mother-of-all-sea-caves like it was <NUM>. back then the underground observation platform was small and a chain-linked fence separated us from <NUM> stellar sea lions in repose fifty feet below us on the rocks. it was a crowded mass of pinniped mayhem that autumn; a reddish-brown herd of eumetopias jubatuses; young males that can weigh a literal ton each, and paunchy cows in their respective harems looking coy and for some action, and the little ones, yearlings, just hanging out and lounging about causing a ruckus. if you’ve got binoculars, bring them.come to think of it, maybe that was sweaty teddy from toledo i smelled, standing just a wee bit too close that afternoon elbowing his way to the front of the pack for a closer look. it’s been a while since i made that memorable trip down the hole. imagine the superdome on a reduced scale, as long as a football field and twelve stories tall with the green ocean pouring through the cave’s entrance. sea lions’ echoes ricochet off cavern walls decorated with algae and lichen stained in random mosaics of green, red and shades of purple. outside the cave perched on rocky ledges are guillemots and black cormorants, and over there, gulls galore swirl and twirl and nest and screech and paint the surrounding cliffs guano white. and not far from shore, often within sight and always a delight, are spouting gray whales plowing north or south, to alaska or mexico, depending on the season.gorgeous and <NUM> feet high, heceta head lighthouse was built in <NUM>, sits on a <NUM>-foot-high bluff and has been lauded as the most visited and beloved lighthouse in america. that very well might be. despite the lighthouse undergoing significant renovations through <NUM>, which might make a lighthouse tour problematic, it shines a long, sweeping beam of light visible <NUM> miles out to sea and is regarded as the strongest light on the oregon coast. according to old black-and-white photos from the turn of the century, the surrounding headlands were devoid of the dense evergreen forest one finds today because a fire leveled the hillside back then rendering it a barren charcoal wasteland. recovered now, it’s rich and lush green which is understandable given the drenching the oregon coast suffers during winter and spring.blessed with a spectacular setting and romantic ambiance, the refurbished assistant lighthouse keeper’s house, big, white and two-stories tall, is now a classy bed-and-breakfast and extremely popular. so plan ahead if its on your to-do list as there can be a long waiting list to contend with. it can handle <NUM> guests at a time, has six queen beds and six bathrooms, plus a fully-equipped guest kitchen. a bit pricey for some, the cost is mitigated by a renowned seven-course gourmet breakfast. the accompanying <NUM>-page cookbook, packed with colorful photographs and delicious recipes, must be purchased separately.cape perpetua, another immense forested headland that juts out into the pacific and rises to a respectable <NUM> feet above sea level (paved road access and parking available up top) is another must-stop on your drive up the coast. from strategically placed viewpoints you can see many miles out to sea and up and down the coast. southward are cascading mountain shoulders in silhouette plunging through fog into the burly ocean below. looking north through breaks in the spruce are miles of flat beach and the tiny, delightful ocean-side village of yachats (“yah-hots”) situated near the mouth of a river of the same name and pronunciation.though dominating the landscape, the cape isn’t the only attraction in the u.s. forest service’s cape perpetua scenic area which includes <NUM>,<NUM> acres of old-growth douglas fir, spruce and western hemlock. the scenic area also claims bragging rights to a giant, <NUM>-year-old sitka spruce that towers <NUM> feet high and boasts a <NUM>-foot circumference near its base. do not cut this tree down for firewood. it’s protected by law and in <NUM> was recognized as an official “heritage tree,” a guilt offering no doubt on account of the rabid clear-cutting that’s pretty much decimated the vast majority of oregon’s coastal mountains.looking sadly up at the silent sentinel of the siuslaw, sniff, it’s hard to imagine what the coast range must have looked like <NUM> years ago before it was gifted away to the powers and mowed to the nub. it was all i could do to keep from wrapping my arms around that big, beautiful chunk of wood. but that would give me away, wouldn’t it?back in the <NUM>s the forest service constructed a visitors center, vibrant now and chock full of information and activities, cultural and natural history exhibits, a theater showcasing nature-themed films, and an interactive children’s science area. it’s not your average visitors center. those yearning for a hike will love the <NUM> miles of trails that wend through old growth and out onto biologically rich, other-worldly tidepools near the ocean’s edge.but be careful; occasionally copious amounts of salt water squirt through the air, water trapped in geologic anomalies like the devil’s churn - a big crack that fills up and explodes like old faithful when competing waves collide. and don’t forget to visit cook’s chasm and the spouting horn.meaning to fear-monger, i’m here to remind you that the ocean is not to be trifled with. plenty of dead people would testify, if they could, to the potential dangers here and elsewhere along the coast, like the state parks at yachats up the road a short way. the danger is especially acute during winter storms and at high tide. turn your back at the wrong time while you’re engaged with the pretty starfish and you risk being overrun by a sneaky two-story wave that will crush you against the rocks, pulverize your skull to mush and drag your limp body out to sea. it happens.i’ve said it before and i’ll say it again: the most scenic stretch of the coast begin at yachats two miles north of cape perpetua and ends near brookings on the california border - the southern oregon coast. and of all the quaint little villages along the way, unpretentious yachats definitely makes my a-list. with a population of around <NUM>, its diminutive size doesn’t accurately reflect the rich lifestyle, beauty and restful nature this gem serves up. retirees and second-home owners aren’t the only ones drawn to yachats; the young have been lured here as well, artists and romantics inspired by basaltic headlands, towering green mountains, miles of empty sand beaches and tidepools waiting to be explored, crashing white surf on the ragged edge of town, and a beautiful meandering river full of life.casual visitors in-the-know take the time to stop and explore this laid-back little secret, this outdoor-lover’s delight. its popularity is attested to by <NUM>-plus lodges, cottages, inns, motels, hotels and cabins, not to mention numerous vacation rentals, many with spectacular ocean views. clean, orderly and quaint are understatements. the small town provides fine dining, on a modest scale, art galleries, bistros and specialty shops. there are miles of public beach to explore, walking and bike paths to amble along, three state parks within the village proper, and an expensive supermarket for those who don’t have the time to run to the big city of newport (another attraction to the area) twenty-five miles up the coast.we always swing through coastal-themed yachats on our many drives down the <NUM>, a mandatory stop. it’s some of the best oregon has to offer due in part to its relative isolation, tucked at the foot of the coastal mountains. yachats is special for those longing for peace and quiet, invigorating scenery, a friendly atmosphere and a welcoming community, all within a vibrant natural setting that will have

are getting into the six-figure range in pre-bidding for the namescon live auctionheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!in a few weeks domain name investors from around the world will converge in las vegas for namescon, the largest event in the domain industry. one of the highlights of the conference is the live domain auction hosted by rotd and pre-bidding has already started on namejet, and like the title says, there are already six-figure bids.if you’ve never been to a live domain auction i can tell you – it’s a rush that’s hard to explain, at least for a domain geek like me. monte cahn, one of the most respected domain industry veterans will be running the auction again this year and from what i’ve seen over the years, when monte’s involved, a lot of the truly premium domains come out.so i’m not incredibly surprised that we’re already starting to see six-figure bids come out in pre-bidding more than two weeks before the auction. the two domains with six-figure bids are:other notable domains with strong interest in the pre-bidding phase are: pen.com, profile.com, shock.com, price.com, stop.com, cork.com, and the list goes on. i think it’s safe to say that some of the best one-word .coms out there are going to hit the open market during the live auction at namescon this year.given that last year even two-word .coms like myworld.com broke the $<NUM>m mark i think it’s safe to say this is likely going to be one of the most exciting live auctions yet. as usual i’ve submitted a handful of names to the auction and i’ll be interested to see which ones make the cut.one strange thing i’ve learned about myself is that for some reason, when i’m in a live auction i end up with a rum and coke in my hand. honestly i pretty much never drink rum and coke, it’s one of my least favorite drinks, but years ago i started drinking them during live auctions and now it’s become a bit of a tradition. if any of my readers are going to be at namescon, feel free to join me for one, maybe you can start a new tradition yourself!you can see the full list of domains in pre-bidding for the namescon auction here.source:

audio: click heremike gleason: it is my privilege now to welcome in greg weldon, ceo and president of weldon financial. greg has over three decades of market research and trading experience, specializing in metals and commodity markets and even authored a book in <NUM> titled gold trading bootcamp, where he accurately predicted the implosion of the u.s. credit market and urged people to buy gold when it was only $<NUM> an ounce.he is a highly sought-after presenter at financial conferences throughout the country, and is a regular guest on financial shows throughout the world, and it’s good to have him back here on the money metals podcast.greg, thanks for joining us today. and it’s nice to talk to you again. how are you?greg weldon: i’m great, thanks. my pleasure, micheal.mike gleason: well, when we had you on back in mid-august you were optimistic about gold at the time. we had a pretty good move higher, shortly thereafter that ended up with gold hitting a one year high. but it stalled out around $<NUM>,<NUM> in early september and we’re currently back below $<NUM>,<NUM> as we’re talking here on wednesday afternoon. gold hit resistance at about the same level in the summer of last year, so give us your update as to your current outlook. what drivers, if any, do you see that can push gold through that $<NUM>,<NUM> resistance level in the months ahead, greg?greg weldon: yeah, well, exactly as you said. you had the move that we were anticipating when we last spoke and it kind of had already started from the <NUM>-ish level. all of this fitting into the kind of bigger picture, technical structure that still leads to a bullish resolution. but as you accurately mentioned, you got up to what have been close to, not quite even towards last summer’s highs around $<NUM>,<NUM>, $<NUM>,<NUM>. in this case, around $<NUM>,<NUM> and ran out of steam.the dollar kind of changed some of the picture and the thought process linked to the fed changed some of the picture. so, you embarked on a downside correction. $<NUM>,<NUM> was the low, you have a nice little correction from that level. that was the level that equated to <NUM>-day exponential moving average. it’s a level that was just below the <NUM>% fibonnaci retracement of the move up from $<NUM>,<NUM>. actually, the move up from $<NUM>,<NUM> back at the end of <NUM>. so you had real, critical support there. so, to me, everything’s kind of mapped out the way you might expect it to, structurally, in this market.from here, one of two things happens, i think. well, one of three things, anyway. you could be cut if you have a bit of low rally backed up to $<NUM>,<NUM>. you back below it a little bit to dollars; still looks kind of strong. it’s an interest rate differential dynamic as a more hawkish view for the fed is priced into the fed funds; that gets transferred into the two-year and five-year treasury notes. the two-year treasury notes at a record high-yield relative to the german two-year schatzi. so, that lifting the dollar … it’s kind of gravitational pull to the upside. and that is some of the downside risk here; that the rally we just saw is kind of you b-wave and maybe you have a c-wave down towards $<NUM>,<NUM>. that’s kind of an ultimate low. whether or not it plays out that way, longer term we still like it.mike gleason: precious metals have had a pretty respectable year all in all. gold is up about <NUM>% year to date. silver is up about half as much. there isn’t exactly a lot of excitement. it seems like it’s always two steps forward, one step back. sentiment in the physical bullion markets, where we operate, is muted. there are multiple factors to consider as to why metals markets are stuck in a bit of a rut. it seems to us that one of the big ones is the equities market stock prices just keep marching relentlessly higher. either investors have become totally desensitized to risk or maybe there just isn’t as much risk as well think there is. in any event, barring some sort of spike in inflation expectations, which pushes metals and stocks both higher, we don’t see gold and silver breaking out unless investors start getting nervous about stock market valuations and thinking about safe havens. so what are your thoughts about equity markets and how they relate to precious metals, greg? and where do you see stock prices headed in the near term?greg weldon: yeah, i mean it’s a perfect question because the reality is, and we in our daily research we focused on this, in fact yesterday. we haven’t spoken … it sounds like we arranged this question. focusing on the fact that gold, relative to s&p, is at a low. you really are kind of lows that we’ve seen before, but at a level where if you get much lower, you’re breaking down to multi-year lows and this whole thing gets called into question from a technical perspective. but my problem with looking at it from a technical perspective, is that i think the stock market is living in borrowed times. basically, the fed has done exactly what they wanted to do. they have flushed people out of safe havens and into risk assets. that’s the whole idea of qe. it worked. you reflated the stock market. that has facilitated a huge, unprecedented rise in consumer credit.instead of the housing market being the collateral like it was in <NUM> and <NUM>, now it’s the stock market that’s the collateral, the googles and amazons of the world and the facebooks of the world. and you have this demand that is being driven or really being fed by credit. now you see the credit numbers start to slow. they’re unsustainable. you start to see the consumer roll over a little bit. so that’s the number one risk to the stock market; it’s actually the consumer.if you look at the retail sales numbers, outside of automobiles and gasoline, which is price-based, you don’t have much of anything. and you have eating and drinking growth slowing. that’s a key component, a key layer to the discretionary spending that’s an important tell to the bigger picture. the consumer discretionary sector is breaking down against the s&p. so that’s a warning sign to me.you have, in terms of the dynamics around what the expectation is for gdp growth, predicated upon policies that have not yet been even agreed upon, let alone voted upon, let alone implemented, let alone starting to work. so, i worry about that kind of fracture between the expectations, the patience level of stock investors, diminished returns, diminished volumes. i think there’s a stock market risk. that’s one of the reasons we like gold, because what would go hand in hand with that, was some kind of maybe statement or a pull back on the dot plot from the fed that would then cause the dollar to come off its little rally here.mike gleason: let’s play the devil’s advocate maybe a little here. we look at these record stock prices and wonder about what is beyond this extraordinarily high valuations in the past when pe ratios hit these levels, it was a signal that markets were nearing a top. but there’s one big difference between the past and today: the advent of high frequency and machine-driven trading. huge amounts of daily volume is generated by trading algorithms. that is a game changer. these programs don’t sense risk on an emotional level like human traders do. they respond very differently to geopolitical events. so, if today’s markets seem disconnected from reality, perhaps because it’s because they are.now you have been on the front lines, trading in these markets for decades. you were a witness for how markets have transformed in recent years. what is your take on high frequency and algorithmic trading and what does it say about the possibility that current equity market valuations can be sustained or maybe even pushed higher? what are your thoughts there, greg?greg weldon: that’s phenomenal question and it’s very well timed given that we did a big special in september called “shrinkage,” which is a shift in the fed policy here. but if you take now your question, which is pertinent now, and you look at experience, in my experience over decades, it brings back <NUM> right off the bat. we’re not saying the market’s going to crash. there clearly there are a lot of differences. but when you ask about high frequency trading, it sounds to me, the first thing i think of, is portfolio insurance on steroids, times a thousand, times ten thousand. so, the risk in terms of just what is the catalyst that then causes kind of that cascading downside?one of the things we’ve been pointing out to our customers… and by the way, i’m working out a gigantic special that shows just how intriguing some of the similarities are around movements in the dollar, movements in bonds, movements in gold, and movements in stocks, and some of the ratios, and even down to crude oil, fed policy and cpi. now as there was basically from <NUM> to ’<NUM>, once they kicked in the plaza accord, which depreciated the dollar. a lot of intriguing connections there and the special report that i’m writing on this, it’s called “what, me worry?” which we’d love to make available to any of your listeners, first of all, if they want to email me.but in terms of the catalyst, setting it up, again i think the landmines are laying in wait out there. i think if you take an example, one of the things, like i said we’ve been telling our customers, if you take amazon or google. stock are trading at $<NUM>,<NUM> a share. you need $<NUM>,<NUM> to buy one share. so, the volume of trading has diminished dramatically over the last couple of years as the stock prices has gone up. the ownership is huge. and it’s passive, and it’s managed investments, it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t discriminate in terms of what type of investor. the people who want to own these stocks, own them. the dynamic between the price level being so high, nominally speaking, to buy up block shares, the amount of money needed, pure and simple, against the volume, to me, sets up something like you’re talking about that would be exacerbated by a flash crash. so, it becomes very scary in terms of what kind of meltdown could you see if you get the ball rolling to the downside.i still think that this is something that will play out over some time. i think the fed is there. i don’t think this is … there are a lot of differences. i’m not trying to make a direct ’<NUM> comparison. but i’ll tell you what, the risk is there. no doubt about it. the risk is rising.mike gleason: in terms of the fed here, greg, what is your thinking on who it might be that talks over for janet yellen as the next fed chair and then also, tell us what you think they’re going to do here in terms of getting inflation to where they want? basically, what are your general thoughts on the fed and fed monetary policy? clearly everyone’s favorite subject.greg weldon: really, it’s two totally separate questions right now because who is donald trump going to pick versus how inflation going to play out. i think if you look at what the fed is saying, the fed has been very clear. this is where (jerome) powell becomes, what seems to be, and i’m not saying i believe this, i’m just saying it seems that powell’s a logical choice if, if, your goal is to maintain policy. thinking about bringing in a guy like (john) taylor, and the taylor rule and where the natural level of fed funds should be here, he would obviously be a much more hawkish choice. while him and trump might have really gotten along, and maybe there’s a lot trump can learn from him, i don’t think that’s the guy trump wants in terms of policy for trying to get his growth agenda going.in that context, how you maintain continuity, which really isn’t that bad. they’re certainly not tight and they’re not tightening to any nth degree. it’s almost goldilocks material here, inflation aside. powell is a logical choice because you make a headline splash, which of course he loves. you basically make a change, but you kind of keep the status quo.the other one would be (kevin) warsh. he was more away from qe and towards just using interest rates. he’s an interesting kind of dark horse. yellen is certainly a dark horse. what mattes really is how does the fed decide they’re going to deal with this inflation issue when they can’t even decide what’s causing it? because you keep hearing transitory, idiosyncratic. these are the words that being used repeatedly, over and over and over again to describe, and you’ve had one fed official go so far as, and even yellen herself has made comments to the effect of, “we don’t understand why it’s not materializing.”again, kind of back to the taylor model, the basic rule of thumb that the fed is counting on, i.e. hoping for, is that as the labor market continues to tighten wages, inflation will go up and that will support of a general rise in prices. the question now becomes is the natural rate of unemployment lower than we thought it was. or, are there structural differences now, technologically based dynamics in the labor market that has hollowed out the labor market, the reason you still have participation rate while finally up a little, is still so low historically, therein lies the question. what is it kind of keeping inflation back and how does this play out?i think the employment numbers from this month, for september, were huge in the sense it was the biggest wage number … and you know how i break the number down. to the nth degree, this was the real deal. only one month, but still the real deal, and the best wage number we’ve seen since <NUM>. so, will that continue? we know anecdotal evidence is there. will this continue over the next couple of months?if you look at cpi and ppi, the pipeline, the year-over-year dynamics around some of the commodities, god forbid, grains, oil seeds, and tropical commodities started to rally because then you’d have a real problem. look at what the base models are doing. look at what energy potentially you’re going to break out here. so, i think there is some inflation coming and it’s apt to push the fed to have to raise to meet their dot plots, and i think that’s going to be problematic for the equity markets. they’re walking the high wire act with no safety net. it’s a very difficult job.mike gleason: getting back to metals here for a bit. we would like to give our listeners an update on the silver and gold price rigging scandal that erupted a year and a half ago when deutsche bank was forced to acknowledge cheating and turned over mountains of evidence, which may prove damning for a number of other banks. but the courts and regulators have a record of moving slowly, if they do anything at all. now you’re much closer to the futures markets than we are. are you aware of any developments on that front and what do you see as the implications of the civil action against the bullion banks? do you sense that the deutsche bank revelations here led to more honest markets, perhaps because of all that evidence struck fear into banker’s hearts or is it more business as usual for these bullion banks who seem to have so much influence in these markets, greg?greg weldon: i have the sense it’s business as usual. i get the sense that it’s a kind of laissez faire attitude about that because the problem is so big, if we were to actually kind of get unearthed, the impact would be much, much larger and we would know it based on the price section very quickly. it’s a powder keg. it’ll blow at some point. this is something, gosh i’ve been in the business how long, and we’ve been talking about this how long? really, this goes way, way back. the degree to which it has gotten worse is, i mean, the thing you debate, not whether it exists or not. is it going to be somehow uncovered to the extent that it causes that kind of disruption? i think again, this is probably fodder for a great movie… a spy movie or whatever.sure, there’s probably a lot of that kind of thing going on in background, but in terms of the day to day operation of the trading of these metals, i don’t see any tangible impact in the dealings i have here, no.mike gleason: well greg, as we begin to close, give us a sense of what you’re focusing on here, maybe some of the things that we haven’t touched on and then give us a sense of how you’re evaluating these markets for your clients. do you think it’s time to get defensive, go to cash, favor metals and commodities here as an inflation hedge, or does the wave of exuberance in stocks still have a ways to go? any final comments or anything else that you want to leave us with today?greg weldon: well, i think some of that depends on whether they can actually get some kind of job done in washington where the republicans finally realize their own necks are on the chopping block here, so let’s finally ban together and get a tax reform package done. we’ll see whether that happens. i think that might be one of those last gas type of moves for the stock market. it could be a “buy the rumor sell the fact,” but i think lot has been priced in and i think there’s still going to be disappointment down the road for that.i’m watching the consumer specifically. the retail sales numbers have been really poor all year. it’s minuscule gains in discretionary items since january. and the debt numbers are interesting. you’re starting to see a roll over, starting to see rise in delinquency rates. the debt obligations for consumers and for the federal government, by the way, are high despite the fact that rates are still low. can you imagine if the feds actually did push rates a hundred basis points higher over the next however many, <NUM>, <NUM> months? i think that would have a real reverberating effect on the consumer and on the government where deficits are still increasing and they’re at high levels again. no one talks about it. you have $<NUM> trillion dollars in sovereign debt and you’re about to push the five-year note above <NUM>%, which is your trigger to increase cost on funding the debt. man, the land mines are out there.i’m watching all of it. that’s what we do for our clients every single day because never before, have you had to be more plugged in. look at the way things happen so much more quickly now. you asked about what’s the difference from <NUM> years. so much more availability of news, quickly. but the fact of the matter is, the basic thing that we do hasn’t changed at all, which is dissecting all of it, connecting all the dots, and kind of trying to make it all make sense in terms of what the markets are doing and how you might profit from that.mike gleason: well greg, thank you so much for joining us again. we enjoyed it very much and love getting your very studied and experienced outlook on the state of today’s financial world. now before we let you go, please tell folks about weldon financial, how they can find you, and any other information they should know about you and your firm.greg weldon: sure, thanks, appreciate that. we’re found atweldononline.com. we do weldon live, one product, one price. it’s kind of a multi-layered product, although it’s just again, one price. we do daily and we cover daily global macro, fixed income, foreign exchange, stock indexes and etfs, precious and industrial metals, energy, and agricultural commodities. and we tie them all together and we have what we call our trade lab, which is part of weldon live. these as specific trading recommendations in all of those sectors, we’re old school futures guys, so that’s kind of the way we approach it. what we find is a lot of family offices or independent brokers or even individuals out there, and there’s no reason with the way your see etfs now being utilized that the average investor can’t operate more like a hedge fund manager or cta.we try and provide rhyme and reason to what’s going on and then specific strategies to take advantage of it. weldon live found at weldononline.com.mike gleason: well great stuff. thanks so much for your time today, greg. i hope we can talk again down the road. take care and we

those of religion and those without. they vary between the politically motivated - those who believe in morality based self-governance versus those who seek mans dominion over men through man-made, man-interpreted and man-enforced laws. they even vary among believers, some of whom believe in an unwritten separation of church and state versus others who believe only in that which was actually written into our constitution by the founders.if you are looking for a debate, few topics will so readily attract opposition. is it a question of faith or historical fact? it’s hard to get folks to even agree on that. then you will have to somehow separate fact from fiction, as the reporting of these facts is often more hysterical than historical.those who wish america a godless society have developed a plethora of arguments to support their agenda. but arguments are not facts… we watch as lawyers make arguments every day, seldom concerned with any facts or even any sense of real justice. but they can make an argument, sometimes a very successful argument. if their argument is not true, has justice been served? is the argument right if it was made on a premise that was all wrong, even though the argument is effective?america is and has always been one nation under god. though the founders used generic terms like creator to describe that god, the god they meant was their god, of the christian faith. atheists and agnostics have long argued that many of the founders were deists, using washington, jefferson, franklin, paine, hamilton, and madison as proof. however, in each of these cases, a study of their personal writings will debunk the myth.how did america become one nation under god? in dictionaries, the terms “deist,” “agnostic,” and “atheist” appear as synonyms. on this basis, the term deists would include those who believe there is no god, those who believe in a distant, impersonal creator of the universe and those who believe there is no way to know if god exists.a brief study of the founders own writings prove beyond any reasonable doubt that none of the notable founders fit this description. thomas paine talked about “the error of schools” to teach sciences without “reference to the being who is author of them: for all the principles of science are of divine origin.” he stated that “the evil that has resulted from the error of the schools in teaching [science without god] has been that of generating in the pupils a species of atheism.”benjamin franklin’s <NUM> plan of education for public schools in pennsylvania insisted that schools teach “the necessity of a public religion . . . and the excellency of the christian religion above all others, ancient or modern.” franklin proposed a biblical inscription for the seal of the united states; he chose a new testament verse for the motto of the philadelphia hospital; he was one of the chief proponents of a paid chaplain in congress; and when franklin helped found the college which bore his name in <NUM>, it was dedicated as “a nursery of religion and learning” built “on christ, the corner-stone.”on may <NUM>, <NUM>, george washington charged his soldiers at valley forge that “to the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of christian.” in a speech on may <NUM>, <NUM>, he claimed that what children needed to learn “above all” was the “religion of jesus christ,” and that to learn this would make them “greater and happier than they already are.” on june <NUM>, <NUM>, he reminded the nation that “without a humble imitation” of “the divine author of our blessed religion” we “can never hope to be a happy nation”, as he resigned his post as commander-in-chief. washington’s own adopted daughter declared of washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his christianity.hamilton began work with the rev. james bayard to form the christian constitutional society to help spread over the world the two things which hamilton said made america great: (<NUM>) christianity and (<NUM>) a constitution formed under christianity. only hamilton’s death two months later thwarted his plan of starting a missionary society to promote christian government.thomas jefferson himself declared, “i am a real christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of jesus.” as president of the united states, jefferson signed a treaty with the kaskaskia tribe wherein he provided—at the government’s expense—christian missionaries.james madison trained for ministry with the rev. dr. john witherspoon, and madison’s writings are replete with declarations of his faith in god and in christ. in his letter to attorney general bradford, madison laments that public officials are not bold enough about their christian faith in public and that public officials should be “fervent advocates in the cause of christ.” madison did allude to a “wall of separation,” but contemporary writers frequently omit madison’s own definition of that “wall”, which according to madison, was only to prevent congress from passing a national law to establish a national religion.there you have it… do any of these men sound like deists to you? it is not hard to demonstrate that america was indeed born one nation under god or that the god or creator they were referring to was in fact, jesus christ. this alone should lay to rest any honest debate over how america became a nation built upon judeo-christian principles and values. we can go on and on, founder after founder if you want, but these are the men named by most who argue that the founders were at best, deists.why was america formed as one nation under god? the answer is simple, yet of vital importance to every american, regardless of their religious beliefs. the answer begins with these two words, “self-governance”.patrick henry put it this way, “it cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by christians, not on religions but on the gospel of jesus christ”.john adams said it this way, “we recognize no sovereign but god, and no king but jesus! [april <NUM>, <NUM>] and he later explained, “we have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. avarice, ambition, revenge, or gallantry, would break the strongest cords of our constitution as a whale goes through a net. our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”—october <NUM>, <NUM>the point is this - it is historically indisputable that america was born one nation under god. it does not require faith, but instead common logic to understand why. men without a moral compass are incapable of long-term self-governance. the founders knew it because they had seen it. few modern americans have experienced what life would be like in a godless society, void of morality, so they question it. many americans place their trust in man over god, so they pursue it.but there is no question what america was, is, should be or must be in order to retain its position of strength as the freest nation of self-governed individuals on earth. we will either be free as one nation under god, or we will be a nation of fools unaware of our common heritage and on the road to ruin under men in search of power. one does not have to be a christian to understand this. one must only understand man and his insatiable hunger for power.those in search of that power must remove god from society in order to gain access to that power. those who allow them, do so at their own peril. you are of course free to not like this simple truth. but this truth will never change. it is as it has always been…and shall always be.* special thanks to david barton at wallbuilders for some of the reference material used herein.",<DATE>

month. the south and the confederate states of america have been harshly discriminated against and positive historical facts and figures have intentionally been suppressed. dishonest northern historians have unfairly caused southern and confederate history and its heroes, monuments, memorials, and flags to be regulated to a role of less importance than deserved in american history and to be viewed in a negative perspective by much of the american public.u.s president woodrow wilson is quoted as saying “the role of slavery became the proclaimed cause of the civil war because it was necessary to put the south at a moral disadvantage by transforming the contest from a war for independence into a war waged for the maintenance and extension of slavery”. if slavery was all the southern states wanted they could have kept it without a war or firing a shot. the north offered the south the corwin amendment to the u.s. constitution in march <NUM> that would have made slavery permanently legal in america if they would rejoin the union. the south refused and the constitution of the confederate states of america banned the international slave trade. most educated southerners were in favor of gradual orderly emancipation which would have prevented segregation and jim crow laws which were based on northern black codes. the words of confederate general patrick r. cleburne who was killed at the battle of franklin tennessee on november <NUM>, <NUM> are becoming true. “every man should endeavor to understand the meaning of subjugation before it is too late. it means the history of this heroic struggle will be written by the enemy; that our youth will be trained by northern school teachers; will learn from northern school books their version of the war; will be impressed by the influences of history and education to regard our gallant dead as traitors, and our maimed veterans as fit objects for derision”. political correctness and socialist marxist

southern and confederate on national, state, and local levels all across america the confederate flag represents honor, faith, courage, dignity, integrity, chivalry, christian values, respect for womanhood, strong family ties, patriotism, self- reliance, limited constitutional federal government, states rights, and belief in the free enterprise system. it symbolizes the noble spirit of the southern people, the rich heritage, the traditions of the south and the dynamic and vigorous southern culture. no other symbol so proudly says “dixie” as the cross of st. andrew (confederate battle flag) waving in the breeze. liberals have falsely indoctrinated many black americans to believe it represents racism, bigotry, and a painful reminder of slavery. but white christian southerners who fly the confederate battle flag are not the enemy of responsible black americans who are working to better themselves. the confederate flag is the last flag to represent the concept of local control of ones’ life in america. in a larger sense it represents the same values and principles as the original u.s. betsy ross flag: limited constitutional federal government, states rights, resistance to tyranny, and christian principles and values. thus it represents “government of the people, by the people, and for the people with the consent of the governed”. the confederate flag is an internationally recognized symbol of resistance to tyranny. that is why it was flying over the berlin wall when it was being torn down in <NUM> and has been flown by numerous countries or provinces seeking independence. it reminds knowledgeable americans that government is to be held accountable for its actions, and if those actions are viewed as not being in the best interest of the people, there is a price to be paid for it. this fact has not been lost upon the socialist, communist, liberal left and that is why they have spent inordinate amounts of money and energy trying to suppress this powerful symbol of freedom. the confederate battle flag is a christian symbol and that is why proponents of secular humanism (the belief that there is no god and man, science, and government can solve all problems) oppose it. the flag also represents the valor and sacrifice of our southern ancestors in their quest to gain independence and recognition as a sovereign nation. confederate soldiers displayed tremendous bravery in the face of overwhelming odds and blatant tyranny and aggression on behalf of the yankee government that invaded the southern homeland. it was, is, and will continue to be the flag of the region southerners call home, the southland. we are americans, true, but we are also proud southerners.james w. king is commander of the albany georgia usa camp of the

doesn’t matter as long as groupthink persistsheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!despite the ideological and social divides currently plaguing our culture, one common theme seems to hold across all the differences; americans do not like congress. even the relatively apolitical seem to be roused against them, with many speaking out against recent bills and congressional initiatives, and phrases like, “drain the swamp!” abounding on social media.shouldn’t more people lead to better decisions? at least when it comes to government, the answer would seem to be: no. the assumption seems to be that if we could only get the “right” people in office, things would improve. however, it would not seem that the problem is the people in the system, but an inherent flaw in the system itself.social psychology is not a discipline which tends to address issues of political organization. however, many current political issues, including the recent wave of hatred for congress, can be analyzed in the light of social psychological principles, such as the classic theory of groupthink.what is groupthink?first studied by yale psychologist irving janis in the <NUM>s, groupthink refers to the tendency of groups to make bad or even disastrous decisions. groupthink was first studied by social psychologists after the bay of pigs when the question was: how could president kennedy, with a cabinet of experts, have made a decision so flawed he himself would later call it “stupid?” shouldn’t more people lead to better decisions? at least when it comes to government, the answer would seem to be: no.in his <NUM> book victims of groupthink: a psychological study of foreign policy decisions and fiascos, dr. janis identifies three risks for groupthink’s occurrence, which are still taught in psychology classrooms today: desire for cohesiveness, structural faults, and the power of the situation. looking at how congress operates today, it is not hard to see how it is inherently at risk of groupthink and to understand the slew of bad/unpopular decisions which seem to have become commonplace.the three risks for groupthink occurrence:congressmen like justin amash or senators like bernie sanders are often touted as “rabble-rousers.” cohesionthe first risk for groupthink is an overwhelming desire for cohesiveness. groups run the risk of groupthink when they value unity over making the best/ethical decision. very often, when groups value unity too highly, they fall prey to the phenomenon of deindividuation, the foregoing of individual beliefs and principles in favor of those of the group. it no longer matters what the individual believes or wants in such circumstances, it’s a matter of yielding to group influence. symptoms of this desire for cohesion can include the derogation of dissenters, trying to limit the questioning of group decisions, and the existence of mindguards, individuals who ensure that dissent is kept to a minimum.it’s not hard to find examples of these phenomena in the current political atmosphere. congressmen like justin amash or senators like bernie sanders are often touted as “rabble-rousers” who don’t tow the party line. the idea is often expressed that principles should take a backseat to party unity and party accomplishment, which so often takes the form of voting the “right way.” there are also tests for party “purity,” such as the democrats’ recent “pro-choice” test, the idea that a “real” democrat cannot be pro-life.structural faultswhen congressmen like rand paul have filibustered in opposition to their party’s agenda, leaders like john mccain attack them, implying they need to fall in line. the second risk for groupthink is structural faults, specifically insulation and closed leadership. by being insulated from outside voices or dissenting opinions, all while being subjected to leadership which discourages dissent and dictates “how it is,” a group is likely to doom itself to making a poor decision.congress seems to be inherently insulated when it comes to its decision-making. in theory, congresspeople represent their constituency’s interests at the federal level. however, most congress-people are not particularly in touch with their constituency. such insulation is not congress’s fault, but rather a fault in design; washington is geographically isolated from most of the united states. getting in touch with one’s congressperson can be nigh on impossible, especially if one is far from washington. the best-case scenario tends to be leaving messages with congressional aides, but chances for actual direct contact are low. the only exception seems to be on the campaign trail, the goal of which is not governance, but re-election.for senators, such insulation can be doubly strong. with the passage of the <NUM>th amendment, senators became essentially unaccountable to any form of local governance for a majority of their term of office. in theory, the direct election of senators gives locals a chance to vote them out, but it can be hard to remember senators’ specific legislative actions when election season rolls around afterward, which can take several years.the second structural fault which increases the risk of groupthink is that of closed leadership: leaders who say “this is how it is.” such leaders often play the role of mindguards: quashing dissent and trying to ensure that congresspeople behave according to the party line rather than their own beliefs. again, it’s not hard to find instances of this in recent politics. when congressmen like ted cruz or rand paul have filibustered in opposition to their own party’s agenda, republican leaders like john mccain came out to attack them as, essentially, traitors, the implication being that they need to fall in line, their own principles be damned.the power of the situationtime pressures pose a similar risk for groupthink. the third and final risk for groupthink is the power of the situation. very often, our behavior is as much a function of our circumstances as our own individuality. two situational features increase the likelihood of groupthink: perceived threats and time pressure.the idea of responding strongly and quickly to a threat is powerful, even evolutionarily advantageous. however, quick and strong responses are not often, if ever, the best decisions. both parties often frame their agendas in opposition to an enemy, often the opposite party. it’s a matter of “defeating” the other party via unanimous support, with no room for individual principles or beliefs. this is how <NUM>+ page-long legislation gets voted on immediately, with no chance for discussion; action is required, else “they” are going to win!time pressures pose a similar risk for groupthink. the idea of having to get something – anything! – done before “they” can enact their sinister agenda seems to define modern political rhetoric. we have to pass healthcare/tax plans/net neutrality immediately! meanwhile, little chance for elaboration or discussion of these bills’ merits is given, and shockingly, the results are rarely beneficial.until this occurs, the “swamp” is going to remain, no matter who inhabits what office. reducing groupthink’s influencemany strategies exist for combating groupthink. however, two commonalities have emerged across most strategies: the importance of dissent and providing time to examine alternatives. in the current political climate, it is highly doubtful that either of these strategies is feasible at the federal level. congress, as it currently functions, rife with partisan strife and both socially and geographically insulated, does not seem able to resist groupthink. so what might be the solution?even at america’s birth, our founders stressed the danger of a centralized government gaining too much power and ceasing to truly represent their constituents. whatever solution is found, it is of the utmost importance that they are kept in touch with those they represent and that partisan politics do not encourage legislation for the sake of unity, but rather for the sake of principle. until this occurs, the “swamp” is going to remain, no matter who inhabits what office.source: http://freedombunker.com/<NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM>/draining-the-swamp-doesnt-matter-as-long-as-groupthink-persists/",<DATE>

are dealing with an unpleasant reality, a reality that none of them understand, but that is a reality nonetheless. there simply is not enough money to keep funneling into the black hole that is the failed chicago school system. nevertheless, the teacher’s union and their members are clamoring for more and more money for themselves.look at this past week for an example of why chicago is a perfect case study in how liberalism consumes itself. you have rahm emanuel, mayor and far leftist who used to be president obama’s left hand man. you have the chicago school board, all liberals. then you have, finally, the teacher’s union whose leadership and membership act like perfect little soldiers of karl marx. and all three are in conflict.if you want to see liberalism devouring itself, chicago is a great petri dish to observe. there liberals are always pitted against other liberals as they vie for an ever shrinking piece of the pie. those insisting on a bigger slice do not realize the fact that the pie keeps getting smaller because of liberalism in the first place.point of note number one: chicago’s teachers are already among the highest paid in the nation at $<NUM>,<NUM> average salary.point of note number two: chicago schools are some of the worst performing in the state of illinois with <NUM> of the bottom <NUM> schools residing in the city.conclusion: simply dumping money into the system, paying teachers a boatload of cash, and keeping teachers who do not perform does not solve the problem.yet there are the teachers, who are failing to educate our children, striking and demanding more for not educating our children. they have turned down a <NUM>% raise (something only government workers get these days) over <NUM> years. they are demanding raises, job security, and benefit guarantees. at the same time, they are fighting tooth and nail against an evaluation process designed to weed out teachers not earning their already hefty salaries. only in a liberal haven like chicago!what is worse is that the teachers who are striking are mindless zombies jumping because they are being told to jump. some of the signs the useful idiots are carrying are very illustrative of this point.for example, one of the signs carried by the communist red clad strikers said: “schools for people not for profit.”question for that useful idiot. how much “profit” did she make last year? did she pocket anything? oh, you know she did! you can be certain she did not donate her time. but then again, she’s a liberal so don’t expect her to understand her own hypocrisy. it’s ok for her to “profit”, just not anyone else.one sign i have seen a lot reads: “i am a teacher!”yes, but the question is are you a good teacher and did you earn your paycheck? see, that’s the point of the testing program the school’s wants to institute. but the bad teachers and the union leaders are so frightened that they might be found that they will not allow such things.another sign by the afl-cio local #<NUM> reads: “on strike for better schools”well, they certainly can’t get much worse! i say stay on strike! then the school district can hire new teachers to replace the incompetent, lazy teachers with a sense of entitlement who are currently teaching our children. that way schools might actually get better! not what the unionistas mean, but the truth none-the-less.then there is the crazy woman hanging out of a school bus window with a sign: “students before bankers.”huh? that’s just nonsensical. but ok, let’s go with it!the teacher’s union, i am sure, has this moron’s pension invested with a banker somewhere. let’s take that money away from the banker, and her, and write every student a check instead. let them do with it as they please. if they opt to go and get an education, great! if they choose to sit around and smoke crack, so-be-it. but make them sign a waiver saying they understanding that there will be no future benefits if they adopt the later approach.then when this yummy brain decides she wants to retire, she’ll no doubt rant and scream about where her money is. we will just point back to the photographic evidence of her philosophy and remind her that her money, once held by bankers, went to the students instead.oh, and by the way, considering that the strike she supports left <NUM>,<NUM> students out of school, the sign should actually read, if it were honest, “myself before students.”seriously, i have never seen as big a bunch of whiners! or idiots for that matter. there is something seriously wrong with the mentality engrained in many of our teachers these days. note i said “many”. i did not say “all” or even “most”. but there are many who feel they are entitled to be teachers if they simply want to be teachers. yet the rest of us actually have to prove ourselves competent at our profession in order to keep our jobs. and we don’t get guaranteed raises every year because of a contract. no, we have to prove ourselves worthy every year when evaluation time rolls around.i feel sorry for those teachers who are actually good teachers. there are many of them. but the display in chicagoland gives even those good teachers a bad reputation.personally i would let them keep striking and hire replacement teachers. we need people teaching our children who actually want to teach. we don’t need people who look at the profession as a scheme to make nearly twice as much as the average chicago resident paying their salary does.",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE>

journal. so it’s interesting when the paper reports from london that “antibanking sentiment here is still off the charts,” leaving the industry “gun shy about flaunting wealth.” that was also true at the olympics, even though “the games are typically one of the biggest corporate schmoozefests on the calendar.” this is part of what the journal calls “a wave of banker austerity,” with executives skipping the usual “hired black sedan” and champagne, and even resorting to putting up important clients in mere three- or four-star hotels. overall, “the city of london’s high-rolling banking industry is rolling as low as possible,” in order to “avoid displays of wealth that will further inflame an already angry public.”so why is the public so “inflamed” with “antibanking sentiment?” recent events here and in the uk make it easy to see.<NUM>. fool me <NUM> times, shame on youfor britons, at the top of the list stands the libor rate-fixing scandal, in which the uk’s most prominent banks conspired to fix a baseline interest rate that's used to calculate rates on thousands of financial products like mortgages. the scandal continues to unfold, with giants citigroup and chase still awaiting charges, among others.but as is common in episodes where major banks have committed large-scale fraud, in this case involving hundreds of billions of dollars in financial instruments, the most heavily implicated bank, barclay’s, is not facing legal prosecution, merely a large fine. the new york times dealbook described the settlement as “a multimillion dollar financial penalty and modest admission of wrongdoing, but no criminal conviction to affect its operation.” pretty gentle treatment for a firm whose traders, while working to manipulate the key rate, said in emails while executing the collusion: “always happy to help;” “for you, anything;” “done…for you big boy;” and from a more conscientious employee, “i will reluctantly, gradually, and artificially get my libors in line.”especially notable in this connection is the conspicuous absence of bob diamond, the disgraced ex-ceo of barclay’s, from the london games, since diamond “had been a fixture for years at uk events” and “had been planning to attend several olympic events as a guest…[but] after the furor surrounding his resignation, he is expected to stay away.” the banks are politically smart enough to keep their heads down when they look bad.of course, the libor affair pales in its human impact when compared with other recent banking scandals, like the “robo-signing” scandal in the us. in that scam, thousands of homes, mortgaged during the housing bubbles, were foreclosed upon without the required legal standing or paperwork. the implicated banks, including the four us megabanks—bank of america, chase, citigroup and wells fargo—settled the charges with the justice department and the states for $<NUM> billion, an impressive figure. however, the settlement does little for the real human families evicted fraudulently, including three-quarters of a million evictees who were foreclosed upon from the finance crisis through the end of <NUM>, most of whom received a check for $<NUM> each.<NUM>. sanctions-bustersin the fast-moving world of banking scandals, standard chartered of london impressively secured a spot for itself when it was accused by a new york regulator of laundering a quarter trillion dollars in iranian money, in violation of us economic sanctions on the country. you don’t have to support the efforts of the us government to economically strangle iran to appreciate the disregard for law in company emails cited in the criminal charge, including an executive confiding that the iranian trading had “the potential to cause very serious or even catastrophic reputational damage to the group.” standard chartered settled the charges for $<NUM> million, in hopes it can “avoid admitting wrongdoing.”indeed, this type of fraud is increasingly prevalent among the financial sector, with banking giant hsbc accused of laundering mexican drug cartel money, along with cash from saudi banks with terrorism ties. ing bank recently spent millions settling a charge that it also bucked international sanctions to move cuban and iranian money. these above-the-law moves, while possibly helping the peoples of these countries against the suffocation of their economies by the us, no doubt add to the “inflamed” feelings of the general public.<NUM>. one nation under fraudthe power of the financial sector is such that the sec, whose job is to examine financial firms and prevent or punish fraud, has become notorious for avoiding punishing firms for lying, even when dealing with repeat offenders. while financial law allows serious penalties for fraud, including large fines and restrictions on business practices, the sec allows “waivers” for these offenses and has granted them quite liberally to the largest us banks. chase has settled six fraud cases since <NUM>, with settlements that run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, but has argued before the sec that it has “a strong record of compliance with securities laws.” notably, the sec justifies settling these cases and issuing waivers by referring to promises from the firms not to violate the law in the future. yet when the firms are taken back to court for their next act of fraud, their recidivism rarely brings a stiffer penalty, as any mere human would likely receive.in fact, of these waivers issued by the regulator, nearly half go to repeat offenders, “wall street firms that had settled previous fraud charges by agreeing never again to violate the very laws that the sec was now saying that they had broken.” this includes other industry giants like bank of america and also citigroup, which racked up so much fraud it finally did get sanctioned. the ability of the megabanks to weasel out of sanctions for widespread fraud are a third reason industry’s keen to stay below the radar.<NUM>. high-speed glitchesfurther undermining confidence in our financial cornerstones are the recurrent “glitches” in large computerized stock trading systems that have lead to horrifying market swings. may <NUM> saw the stock exchange lose literally trillions of dollars of value in just several minutes, only to recover again within another <NUM> minutes. august of this year began with a similar out-of-control development on the market, as retail trading company knight capital group had a “technology issue” with its brand-new automated stock-trading system. while it was supposed to react to trading by others, the computer system instead placed giant orders to the point that millions of erroneous trades were made, often at inflated prices, such that knight ended up having to seek new equity partners to stay afloat.computer algorithm-based trading strategieslike those used by knight are another product of regulatory loosening over the last two decades, to the point that half of stock trading is now handled by such “high-speed” firms. to compensate for the increased instability such deregulation has brought about, the securities and exchange commission maintains “circuit breakers” to cut off trading if the price of a particular stock behaves erratically. unfortunately, these countermeasures are not activated until <NUM> minutes after the beginning of trading, whereas knight’s algorithm began runaway trading immediately.the upshot of course is to make finance in general and equity trading in particular more suspiciously viewed by the public. as the times put it, the chaotic computer trading was “the latest black eye for the financial markets…drawing renewed attention to the fragility and instability of the nation’s stock markets.”<NUM>. fed by the fednotably, the banks are increasingly dependent on government action for their profits. in recent years, the central bank of the eu and the us federal reserve have engaged in a somewhat desperate mode of economic stimulus, “quantitative easing,” where the fed buys bonds from major banks in order to inject more cash into the banking system, with the goal of lowering interest rates and hopefully increasing economic growth. this bond buying has become a significant profit center for the banking majors, with bond-trading income exploding shortly after each round of (mostly ineffective) monetary “stimulus.” the business press notes that “big trading banks are particularly well positioned to profit when central banks act aggressively. the firms help make markets in bonds and derivatives. when the banks’ clients see the fed take bold steps, they feel encouraged and come off the sidelines to buy more bonds. this increases the amount of business that flows through wall street, but it also lifts the prices of the bonds that banks hold, creating profits for the traders.”the ability of the banking industry to sustain its profitability and power despite scandal after scandal – and after crisis after technological disaster -- speaks to its unparalleled power in the modern economy. but beside the social power of the firms to dominate markets and shape perceptions with ad spending, and their obvious political muscle, the banks also make use of their power in a more everyday fashion, in maintaining relatively high retail interest rates in the us. the mortgage-handling banks are benefiting in historically large terms from the growing spread between the low rates they pay to investors they sell mortgages to, and the higher rates they charge the actual homeowner. the times business section notes that “if the market were functioning properly, the recent drop in the bond rates should have led to a larger decline in mortgage rates for consumers than has actually occurred. instead, the difference between the two rates is increasing.” one suggested reason: “mortgage lenders may also be benefiting from less competition. the upheaval of the financial crisis of <NUM> has led to the concentration of mortgage lending in the hands of a few big banks, primarily wells fargo, jpmorgan chase, bank of america and us bancorp.”this long record suggests why the finance industry

to begin shortly after the new millennium, midway through the oh-oh decade. around the year <NUM>, a sudden spark will catalyze a crisis mood. remnants of the old social order will disintegrate. political and economic trust will implode. real hardship will beset the land, with severe distress that could involve questions of class, race, nation and empire. the very survival of the nation will feel at stake. sometime before the year <NUM>, america will pass through a great gate in history, commensurate with the american revolution, civil war, and twin emergencies of the great depression and world war ii.” – strauss & howe– the fourth turningthis fourth turning was ignited suddenly in september <NUM> as the housing bubble, created by the federal reserve and their criminal puppeteer owners on wall street, collapsed, revealing the greatest control fraud in world history. a crisis mood was catalyzed as the stock market dropped <NUM>%, unemployment surged to highs not seen since <NUM>, foreclosures exploded, and captured politicians bailed out the criminal bankers with the tax dollars of the victims.the mood of the country darkened immediately as average americans flooded their congressmen’s websites and phone lines with a demand not to bailout the felonious wall street banks with $<NUM> billion of tarp. but they ignored their supposed constituents and revealed who they are truly beholden to.trust in the political and financial system disintegrated and has further deteriorated as the ruling elite continue to loot and pillage as if the <NUM>/<NUM> global financial meltdown never happened. from the perspective of the archaic social order there is no longer a crisis. the recovery narrative, flogged ceaselessly by the crooked establishment and their propaganda fake news corporate media mouthpieces, has convinced millions of willfully ignorant americans progress is occurring.could they be right? is the crisis over? has this fourth turning been managed to a successful conclusion by central bankers issuing tens of trillions in debt, politicians spending tens of trillions supplied by taxpayers, bankers rigging financial markets, and consumers leveraging up to maintain their lifestyles? has the exiting corrupt social order successfully retained their power, control and influence over the masses by manipulating the levers of society and fending off their demise? have they already won?this fourth turning just passed its ninth anniversary. the civil war fourth turning lasted only five years, but that was because it was accelerated, with an enormous amount of bloodshed crammed into a short time frame. the american revolution crisis lasted twenty one years. the great depression/world war ii crisis lasted seventeen years. all three prior american fourth turnings ended with an all-out decisive war, with clear victors and vanquished.based on historical precedent, this fourth turning shouldn’t reach its resolution until the mid-<NUM>’s, with a major global conflict on the near term horizon. those who understand that something wicked this way comes are frustrated by the apparent slowness of the progression. they shouldn’t be too anxious for an acceleration.since strauss & howe didn’t formulate their generational theory until <NUM>, this is the first fourth turning in which some people understand the dynamics driving the crisis. does knowledge about a cycle change the underlying forces propelling history? has the establishment oligarchy co-opted the crisis mood of the country to avoid its own demise? or, is this fourth turning just proceeding according to the standard morphology along its two decade long test of survival?i honestly don’t know. this is my first and only fourth turning. what i do know is the crisis began in the time frame predicted by strauss & howe. the catalyst was the <NUM> financial meltdown created by wall street and the federal reserve, just as they had done in <NUM> to catalyze the previous fourth turning. strauss and howe documented the four stages of a fourth turning.a crisis era begins with a catalyst – a startling event (or sequence of events) that produces a sudden shift in mood.once catalyzed, a society achieves a regeneracy – a new counterentropy that reunifies and reenergizes civic life.the regenerated society propels toward a climax – a crucial moment that confirms the death of the old order and birth of the new.the climax culminates in a resolution – a triumphant or tragic conclusion that separates the winners from losers, resolves the big public questions, and establishes the new order.the <NUM> global financial meltdown most certainly produced a sudden shift in mood. average working class americans saw their retirement savings obliterated for the second time in the space of eight years. millions lost their jobs and got thrown out of their homes by the wall street bankers who perpetrated the greatest financial fraud in world history. the american citizens, who overwhelmingly disapproved of tarp, were disregarded as captured corrupt congressmen handed $<NUM> billion of taxpayer funds to the wall street criminals.the darker shift in mood produced the tea party movement and the occupy wall street movement. both movements were co-opted by the establishment and effectively extinguished as change agents. over the next seven years a massive debt produced bubble has been blown in stock, bond and real estate markets to benefit only those in the upper echelon of wealth. wall street is winning in a blowout over main street.as <NUM> morphed into the historic year of vitriol, hate, fake news, russians, pussy grabbing, and an all-out establishment effort to discredit and defeat donald trump – <NUM> saw battle lines drawn and combatants armed. the oligarchs used every propaganda trick in their bag. they used their vast limitless wealth to insure the election of their hand-picked candidate – hillary clinton. black lives matter terrorists slaughtered policemen in cold blood. social justice warriors were triggered on campuses across the land, retreating to safe spaces with crayons and coloring books.antifa fascists rioted, beat trump supporters and attempted to shutdown free speech at every opportunity. violent clashes, provoked by leftists, roiled the country and hardened the resolve of normal people in flyover america. the fake news corporate media produced fake polls showing an overwhelming victory for clinton. the ruling elite underestimated the anger among the silent majority. trump won an unlikely victory.the basket of deplorables and millions of other disillusioned regular people chose the grey champion of this fourth turning on november <NUM>, <NUM>. it was possibly the biggest upset in presidential history. the long awaited regeneracy had arrived. just as the election of fdr marked the regeneracy of the last fourth turning, the election of donald trump marks the regeneracy moment of this crisis.his election has energized the country in positive and negative ways. he has unified factions for and against his agenda. his election has revealed an ingrained establishment (aka swamp creatures) inhabited by politicians of both parties who are intent on sabotaging his presidency. the first ten months of his presidency has been a tumultuous clash between an entrenched establishment and a tweeting, insulting, volatile, unpredictable, rude outsider real estate mogul from nyc.the mood of the country has clearly darkened as <NUM> has progressed. there is no middle ground or compromise. the tension between the two americas rises with each mass shooting, russian collusion revelation, exposure of media bias, proof of hollywood degradation, judicial overreach, soros funded staged protests, donna brazile tell all book and censorship actions by twitter, facebook, and other left wing slanted media outlets.only <NUM>% of americans think the country is headed in the right direction, and they are right. with a $<NUM> trillion national debt, $<NUM> trillion of unfunded welfare liabilities, pension plans underfunded by hundreds of billions, rampant governmental corruption, blatant wall street criminality, undeclared wars being waged across the globe, and a feeble minded corporate propaganda media spewing fake news, the nation has already hit the iceberg and the ship is going down.the level of divisiveness and anger in this country grows exponentially, with the flames being fanned by the corporate media intent on creating a civil war. battle lines are being drawn between republicans and democrats; the establishment gop and the steve bannon alt-right disciples; far left sanders democrats and clinton partisans; blm terrorists and police; soros funded antifa scum and free speech conservatives; sjw’s and normal people; elites and deplorables; whites and blacks; liberals and conservatives; wall street and main street; hollywood deviants and people with morals; muslims and infidels; those who are awake and those who are ignorant; gun owners and gun confiscators; surveillance state and citizens being surveilled; young and old; haves and have nots; workers and parasites; government union workers and taxpayers; left wing academia and those with common sense; arrogant hubristic oligarchs and humble hard working americans.if you can’t comprehend the sense of foreboding engulfing the nation and the globe, you aren’t paying attention. despite a global recovery narrative and record high stock markets supercharged by irresponsible debasing schemes implemented by captured central bankers, the world is hurtling relentlessly toward conflict, war and bloodshed. every previous american fourth turning saw an upwards ratchet in violence, death and technological killing devices. this fourth turning will see a continuation of this trend. fourth turning wars are always decisive, with clear winners and losers.the revolutionary war erupted two years after the boston tea party catalyst and lasted for eight years. the civil war swept the country into conflict shortly after lincoln’s election. the second world war didn’t encroach on the lives of americans until <NUM> years after the <NUM> great crash. each crisis will have its own dynamics, pace, and timing, based upon specific events, leadership decisions, and generational reactions to the incidents and episodes driving the crisis. we are in year nine of this fourth turning and a looming bloody conflict is just over the horizon, but the vast majority of the american populace is unprepared and unaware for such a trial by fire.the <NUM> volcanic eruption has continued to flow along the channels of distress impacting nations across the globe. yeoman efforts by the deep state to keep the molten flow within controlled channels are failing, with the eruption about to burst free and cause global havoc on a grand scale, as predicted by strauss & howe.“imagine some national (and probably global) volcanic eruption, initially flowing along channels of distress that were created during the unraveling era and further widened by the catalyst. trying to foresee where the eruption will go once it bursts free of the channels is like trying to predict the exact fault line of an earthquake. all you know in advance is something about the molten ingredients of the climax, which could include the following:economic distress, with public debt in default, entitlement trust funds in bankruptcy, mounting poverty and unemployment, trade wars, collapsing financial markets, and hyperinflation (or deflation)social distress, with violence fueled by class, race, nativism, or religion and abetted by armed gangs, underground militias, and mercenaries hired by walled communitiespolitical distress, with institutional collapse, open tax revolts, one-party hegemony, major constitutional change, secessionism, authoritarianism, and altered national bordersmilitary distress, with war against terrorists or foreign regimes equipped with weapons of mass destruction”the fourth turning – strauss & howethe american revolution military conflict was with an external enemy. the civil war was an internal conflict between americans. world war ii was again an external conflict. will the coming conflict be domestic, foreign or both? every fourth turning has internal and external struggles and skirmishes. loyalists battled patriots during the american revolution. both sides attempted to seek european support during the civil war.a resolute opposition despised fdr and even sought to organize a military coup to seize power of the government. this fourth turning is progressing along a dual path of internal and external clashes destined to define the events which will propel the world towards a climax and resolution of this fourth crisis period in u.s. history.the apparent slowness of this fourth turning is not unusual and the rise in the stock market in the midst of the crisis does not alleviate the dire circumstances of the crisis. from its low in <NUM> the stock market rose by over <NUM>% by <NUM>, in the midst of the great depression, before another <NUM>% plunge. the current fed financed stock market rally has driven stocks up about <NUM>% from the <NUM> lows. stock markets do not define when a crisis has ended for the majority of americans because so few people own a significant amount of stock.the average american suffered economic hardship throughout the <NUM>s, just as average americans have continued to suffer economic hardship since <NUM>. as americans dealt with privation and poverty in the late <NUM>s the coming global conflict was brewing. animosities, prejudices and resentments, exacerbated by economic turmoil, stirred militaristic ambitions of hubristic rulers in europe and asia. the parallels with the current international dynamic are eerie. the exact timing of the chaotic dangerous portion of this fourth turning is uncertain, but it can’t be escaped.“don’t think you can escape the fourth turning the way you might today distance yourself from news, national politics, or even taxes you don’t feel like paying. history warns that a crisis will reshape the basic social and economic environment that you now take for granted. the fourth turning necessitates the death and rebirth of the social order. it is the ultimate rite of passage for an entire people, requiring a luminal state of sheer chaos whose nature and duration no one can predict in advance.” – strauss & howe – the fourth turninghttps://www.theburningplatform.com/<NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM>/the-unbearable-slowness-of-fourth-turnings/part <NUM>in part <NUM> of this article i provided the background regarding the phases of fourth turnings and where we stand nine years into this period of crisis. i will now ponder what could happen during the remainder of this fourth turning.“history offers no guarantees. obviously, things could go horribly wrong – the possibilities ranging from a nuclear exchange to incurable plagues, from terrorist anarchy to high-tech dictatorship. we should not assume that providence will always exempt our nation from the irreversible tragedies that have overtaken so many others: not just temporary hardship, but debasement and total ruin. losing in the next fourth turning could mean something incomparably worse. it could mean a lasting defeat from which our national innocence – perhaps even our nation – might never recover.” – strauss & howe – the fourth turningthe most important point to comprehend is the death of the existing social order always occurs during the course of a fourth turning. thus far, those constituting the deep state hierarchy have fended off their demise. they are utilizing every tool at their disposal to retain their wealth, power and control. as their mass media propaganda machine falters, they have redoubled their rigging of financial markets to promote a narrative of economic recovery, while further enriching themselves and their cronies.it is clear they have reached the peak of financial manipulation, money printing, and artificial interest rate suppression. the narrative is faltering. their last and final option to retain power is war. as their “everything bubble” (stocks, bonds, real estate) inevitably implodes, civil and/or global military conflict will be utilized to distract the populace from their deep state domestic disasters.the time for compromise is long past. there are no moderates left in the political spectrum. the mood of the country is clearly trending towards conflict. trump, as the grey champion of this fourth turning, has proven to be a lightning rod of hate. he infuriates his political opponents, the left wing media, many in his own party, foreign leaders, billionaires and most worrisome to his well-being – the shadowy surveillance state intel operatives.his own fbi and cia have been subverting his presidency and attempting to initiate his impeachment or as a last resort – coup. after running a campaign championing a reduction in foreign military intervention in the middle east, reducing commitments to nato and increasing cooperation with russia, it appears trump has been taken into a room and told the military industrial complex calls the shots. trump has clearly made a self-preservation decision to avoid being jfk’d.the possibility of global catastrophe is not taken seriously by the vast majority of americans. it’s been over seventy years since the last global conflict and most of the people who experienced the horror are dead. we’ve forgotten the past and are condemned to relive it, just as we do every eighty or so years. the lack of volatility in financial markets portends drastic levels of volatility as the perception markets can’t fall has lured wall street <NUM> something mbas and the investor class into a sense of invincibility.geopolitical tensions have been rising dramatically over the last few years, with religious extremism, oil, petro-dollar, historical rivalries and nationalism driving the world towards conflict. these extreme economic and geopolitical stresses are coinciding along the same timeline and will erupt simultaneously, catalyzing the climactic half of this fourth turning.“the risk of catastrophe will be very high. the nation could erupt into insurrection or civil violence, crack up geographically, or succumb to authoritarian rule. if there is a war, it is likely to be one of maximum risk and effort – in other words, a total war. every fourth turning has registered an upward ratchet in the technology of destruction, and in mankind’s willingness to use it.” – strauss & howe – the fourth turningwith the house of saud descending into madness as religious zealots, kings, princes, and foreign infiltrators vie for control of their depleting oil riches, and tens of billions in high tech weaponry provided by american arms dealers, a middle east conflagration is a certainty. iran has been winning the proxy wars in syria, iraq, and yemen. saudi arabia and israel are determined to stop iran’s expansion at any cost.mixing religious extremism, oil riches, gas pipelines, opium, egotistical dictators, nuclear bombs, hatred and territorial ambitions into the deepening militaristic global mood change is destined to spark a chain reaction of unintended consequences and unyielding responses. the next middle east war will not be a proxy war. it will be a fight to the death.you need a scorecard to figure out the alliances, opponents and wildcards. iran appears to be aligned with iraq, qatar, syria, hezbollah, yemen, and russia. saudi arabia appears to be aligned with israel, uae, and the united states. various factions, who include turkey, isis, al qaeda, and the kurds, are fighting one or more of these parties. in many cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend applies.peace and compromise are out of the question at this point. it’s just a matter of who pulls the trigger to kick off the fireworks. it looks like saudi arabia is willing to gamble everything on a final showdown with iran. once the shooting starts and the u.s. and russia are sucked in, all bets are off on what happens next. diplomacy will not be an option.this scenario presumes a korean conflict doesn’t happen first. with reckless actions on the part of kim jung un and reckless rhetoric from both sides, the odds of a korean conflict are the highest since the <NUM>s. with three carrier groups sitting off the korean coastline, just one provocative act or mistake could unleash a fusillade from both sides, killing hundreds of thousands in a matter of days. global treaties, alliances and economic realities are pushing global powers in unforeseen directions, just as this fourth turning enters its most dangerous phase. human failings are the constant throughout history. but, human failings resulted in <NUM>,<NUM> deaths during the american revolution crisis. they could result in hundreds of millions of deaths during this crisis.the u.s. and europe’s provocative actions with nato forces surrounding russia, the ongoing ukraine civil war, the syrian civil war, and false accusations of rigging the u.s. presidential election have pushed russia into a closer alliance with china. saudi arabia has also strengthened ties with china, as the debt financed shale oil boom has lessened u.s. purchases of opec oil.the eu is falling apart, as debt creation has failed to revive economies, governments are bankrupt, muslim hordes destroy their social fabric, and a revolutionary spirit is in the air. germany, france, sweden and most of europe have signed their own death warrant by allowing their countries to be invaded by millions of young muslim men intent on destroying their way of life. global disorder is expanding exponentially and is surely leading towards war.war will either be the trigger for the forthcoming financial crash or a direct result of the forthcoming financial crash. the core elements of this fourth turning (debt, civic decay, global disorder) are going to juxtapose and connect, accelerating into a chain reaction of chaos, civil uprising, global war, mass casualties, the fall of empires, and ultimately the destruction of the existing social order (aka deep state).when americans see their wealth vaporized for the <NUM>rd time in less than two decades by the same criminal bankers and corrupt politicians, they will not forgive, forget and bail them out again. they will seek out the guilty and make them pay through street justice. the fraudulent deep state controlled scheme is beyond redemption and must be destroyed in order for a constitution based free market system to be reintroduced. the result could also be dictatorship or worse. the outcomes will be determined by the actions we take as citizens.with a debt inundated global economy already slowing; panicked central bankers beginning to take their foot off the accelerator; massively overvalued stock, bond and real estate markets; consumers in debt up to their eyeballs; stagnant wages; rising inflation; currency and trade wars heating up; deficits rising again; and gridlocked legislative bodies, the onset of war in the middle east would cause oil prices to skyrocket and trigger the stock market collapse <NUM>.<NUM>.at this point, even the slightest hint of wage inflation causing interest rates to rise even modestly would prompt a market meltdown. the perfect storm is headed our way. the triple threats of debt, civic decay and global disorder cannot be avoided. we can’t defy the chaos set in motion by the cyclical nature of history. the seasons cannot be reversed, so we must brace ourselves for the oncoming storms.“the future’s uncertain and the end is always near.” – jim morrison“no one here gets out alive.” – jim morrisonthere are no guarantees or certainties regarding what happens over the remaining decade or so of this fourth turning. don’t believe god will exempt our empire from the tragedies that have befallen past empires. debasement and total ruin are not inconsequential possibilities. hubris, arrogance, decadence, and debt have devastated previous global empires and are present today in copious quantities as the american empire enters its critical threshold of national survival. there are a myriad of internal and external competing forces which threaten both the status quo and very existence of our nation.there will be moments of extreme danger and severe threats in the coming years. i do not consider the russian people or the chinese people my enemies, but my government will attempt to convince us to go to war against them, in order to maintain their empire. human nature has not changed over the course of history, but the technological advancements in warfare have placed the ability to obliterate the planet into the hands of weak minded malevolent men, whose egotism and thirst for power know no bounds. human flaws and frailties could endanger the world and its inhabitants. do you trust the leadership of your country to do what’s in your best interest?i do not trust my government. i do not trust the puppet politician front men for the deep state. i do not trust the mega-corporations who dominate our economy. i do not trust central bankers and their wall street owners. i do not trust the fake news corporate media. i do not trust the military industrial complex. i do not trust the leaders of organized religion.i trust my own instincts, reasoning ability, and critical thinking skills. i trust my immediate family members. i trust some of my neighbors. i trust more of people i’ve met through my blog than i’ve met face to face. i trust normal people living normal lives across this once great country. i trust the people who distrust the people and things i distrust. as events spiral out of control, we will need to pick and choose our friends carefully.if or when the government attempts to force my three sons into a war on behalf of the vested interests to retain their wealth and power, i will resist with every ounce of strength in my aging body. they will not become cannon fodder for the deep state. we don’t know the events and path which will drive the remainder of this crisis, but we do know our choices will matter.this is no time for apathy and complacency. for those who grasp generational theory and the cycles of history, the seemingly unbearable slowness of this fourth turning is actually a blessing. the slowness allows more time to prepare. if you haven’t prepared for the coming saecular winter, time is growing short. the skies are darkening. our rendezvous with destiny awaits.“reflect on what happens when a terrible winter blizzard strikes. you hear the weather warning but probably fail to act on it. the sky darkens. then the storm hits with full fury, and the air is a howling whiteness. one by one, your links to the machine age break down. electricity flickers out, cutting off the tv. batteries fade, cutting off the radio. phones go dead. roads become impossible, and cars get stuck. food supplies dwindle.day to day vestiges of modern civilization – bank machines, mutual funds, mass retailers, computers, satellites, airplanes, governments – all recede into irrelevance. picture yourself and your loved ones in the midst of a howling blizzard that lasts several years. think about what you would need, who could help you, and why your fate might matter to anybody other than yourself. that is how to plan for a saecular winter.don’t think you can escape the fourth turning. history warns that a crisis will reshape the basic social and economic environment that you now take for granted.” –

education and research and health care — they haven’t been made as some grand scheme to redistribute wealth from one group to another…this is not some socialist dream.”yet, in <NUM>, obama summarized his plan to make the tax code fairer by saying “i think when you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody.” obama may not be cut out of the same cloth as lenin, but he is a socialist and socialism is his agenda. marxism spawned socialism. marxism produced the foundation of european welfare state socialism. the european model tried to nationalize socialism, as with the bolshevik revolution, but with less success. after the failure of nationalization through revolution, european socialists realized that free enterprise in private hands produced capital (money) which they could then steal through taxation and then redistribute to all through social programs, thereby achieving socialism. where european socialism prevails, there is a cost. according to paul roderick gregory, “the european welfare state takes one half of national output to provide state health care, pensions, extended unemployment benefits, income grants, and free higher education.” obama feverishly promotes socialism as just described.fairness is the vehicle obama uses to implement socialism. he just wants to be fair and for everyone to have a level playing field. fairness is the mantra of socialists. fairness in healthcare, fair share of tax payments, fair prices for all through state controlled markets, fairness for the environment through green energy, racial fairness through enforced civil rights, fairness in gender equality and protection of homosexuality through tough hate crime laws, to name a few. all of this fairness must be executed and enforced through an all-powerful centralized government by controlling everyone to be able to provide all of life’s needs from the cradle to the grave. this is obama european socialism pure and simple and he is lying when saying he does not want to redistribute wealth. redistribution is the cornerstone of socialism. and herein lies the reason why obama hates the constitution. the constitution of the united states

the islamic state as a landholding terrorist organization. tillerson explained that u.s. forces and diplomats must work to prevent the resurgence of isis and the domination of syria by iranian-backed terrorists. but cardin maintained the new policy exceeds anything authorized by congress.“i am extremely disappointed that the trump administration announced a significant change in u.s. policy — the commitment of u.s. forces for an indefinite period of time in syria — without first consulting congress,” cardin said. “the trump administration lacks the authority to keep u.s. military forces in syria after the defeat of isis.”trump, like former president barack obama, has traced the legal authority for counter-isis operations back to the legislation that authorized military action action against al qaeda in response to the sept. <NUM>, <NUM> terrorist attacks. isis formed out of the remnants of al qaeda’s affiliate in iraq. tillerson tied the new syria policy to that legal basis by noting the potential for isis to rehabilitate itself in the absence of u.s. forces.“isis presently has one foot in the grave, and by maintaining an american military presence in syria until the full and complete defeat of isis is achieved, it will soon have two,” he said.in tillerson’s telling, such a complete victory — over isis or iranian forces in the country — depends on the success of a broader effort to bring peace and stability to syria.“ungoverned spaces, especially in conflict zones, are breeding grounds for isis and other terrorist organizations,” he said. “u.s. disengagement from syria would provide iran the opportunity to further strengthen its position in syria. as we have seen from iran’s proxy wars and public announcements, iran seeks dominance in the middle east and the destruction of our ally, israel. as a destabilized nation and one bordering israel, syria presents an opportunity that iran is all too eager to exploit.”the unveiling of the plan could renew congressional interest in crafting a new legislation defining the president’s legal authority to conduct counter-terrorism operations. for years, lawmakers in both parties have struggled to agree on the details of a new authorization of the use of military force.“congress has been unable to bridge the gap between those who see a new aumf as primarily an opportunity to limit the president and those who believe constraining the commander in chief in wartime is unwise,” senate foreign relations chairman bob corker, r-tenn., said during a recent hearing.tillerson’s announcement is sure to spark a new round of debate on the policy, though. “the state and defense departments must immediately consult with the members of the senate foreign relations committee, which retains jurisdiction over the use of military force,” cardin said.",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,ben cardin: trump's new syria plan is illegal,joel

""fact check: no, the clintons were not paid millions by russia.""the accompanying article proves nothing of the sort.the supposed fact check comes in response to a tweet this week from president trump that read, ""russia sent millions to clinton foundation."".@foxandfriends ""russia sent millions to clinton foundation""— donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) october <NUM>, <NUM>he is not wrong, and the newsweek article acknowledges as much.it acknowledges that former president bill clinton received a generous $<NUM>,<NUM> speaking fee in <NUM> from a kremlin-linked bank with ties to uranium one, a canadian uranium company that had mines in the u.s. the newsweek article also acknowledges a separate new york times report that showed uranium one's chairman donated approximately $<NUM>.<NUM> million to the clinton foundation in four separate installments as his company was being acquired by a russian nuclear energy firm called rosatom.there's more from the times report, and none of it reflects well on the clintons:as the russians gradually assumed control of uranium one in three separate transactions from <NUM> to <NUM>, canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the clinton foundation. uranium one's chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $<NUM>.<NUM> million. those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the clintons, despite an agreement mrs. clinton had struck with the obama white house to publicly identify all donors. other people with ties to the company made donations as well.the only thing the newsweek fact check disputes is whether the millions paid had anything to do with rosatom's successful efforts to secure approval from the state department to acquire uranium one. the u.s. committee on foreign investment gave the go-ahead in october <NUM>, handing the russian state-owned nuclear agency control of <NUM> percent of the uranium in america.it's unclear whether the russian cash given to the clinton foundation had anything to do with bill clinton's attempts in <NUM> to facilitate meetings with rosatom executives. it's also unclear whether the payments had anything to do with his decision to meet privately with russian president vladimir putin that same year.but this is still a long way off from, ""fact check: no, the clintons were not paid millions by russia.""aggravatingly enough, the headline that appears on newsweek's website is evenhanded and reasonable. it reads simply, ""did russia send money to bill clinton's foundation like trump says? fact-checking the president's claim."" it's the social media version of this headline that's atrocious.that said, like the tweeted headline, the body of the fact check also makes claims that it can't quite back, including, ""president is stretching the truth about the clinton foundation and money it received.""well, perhaps. but the clinton foundation did take in millions from the russians. that's what the president tweeted.here's how the newsweek fact check concludes, ""yes, the foundation received money and bill clinton was paid to give a speech, but there's no evidence the clintons were paid by russians to push through the uranium deal.""this is correct, and it'd probably be devastating were it a thing the president actually said. but he didn't quite say that.he implied it, sure. but what's the use of fact checking

in its entire fleet, the group of <NUM> represented a huge target for u.s. planes.at a pentagon news conference last wednesday, reporters wanted to know why american forces did not take out more than <NUM> trucks. why not all <NUM>, or something close to that? a u.s. official said the american attackers simply ran out of ammunition.""there were <NUM>, i think, to begin with, and then you hit <NUM>. why didn't you go back?"" a reporter asked operation inherent resolve spokesman col. steve warren.""frankly, the aircraft expended <NUM> <NUM>-pound bombs, and all of their ammunition,"" warren answered. ""so they — they shot everything they had and then they had to go home.""journalists had another question: if oil is vitally important to the islamic state, why didn't the u.s. hit the tanker trucks long ago, given that the american anti-isis operation began in september <NUM>?""if it's so important to cut off the oil shipments, the critical revenue source for isis, why did it take so long to take out <NUM> oil tanker trucks?"" a reporter asked.warren explained that american officials were deeply worried about harming the truck drivers, who were working for the islamic state but might not be isis themselves. u.s. officials settled on a plan to drop leaflets on the trucks about <NUM> minutes before the raid, warning the drivers that an attack was coming, while u.s. pilots flew low passes over the area. planning all that took time.""this is our first strike against tanker trucks,"" warren said. ""we have been striking oil infrastructure targets since the very beginning of this operation. what we found out was that many of our strikes were only minimally effective. we would strike pieces of the oil infrastructure that were easily repaired.""warren said u.s. officials conducted a study and decided to focus on the islamic state's oil distribution network — trucks. but the problem was the drivers.""we have not struck these trucks before,"" warren said. ""we assessed that these trucks, while although they are being used for operations that support isil, the truck drivers, themselves, [are] probably not members of isil; they're probably just civilians. so we had to figure out a way around that. we're not in this business to kill civilians, we're in this business to stop isil — to defeat isil.""american officials decided on the leaflet-and-buzz plan. ""we spent some time developing ... the leaflets, the low pass,"" warren said. ""we did some ... some strafe runs as well — to kind of shoo people away without harming them. so we had to go through that whole process of one, determining whether or not we felt it was in our best interest to strike these trucks. and then once we determined that, yes, it is in our interest to strike these trucks, how do we go about ensuring that we're able to mitigate the potential of civilian casualties? and these things take time.""finally, when all the work had been done, <NUM> islamic state trucks were found in one place. it was an inviting target.""these trucks were queued up,"" warren said. ""they were sitting sort of on flat desert. there wasn't really anything recognizable as a road around. it was just out there on the desert floor in the vicinity of one of these oil fields, one of these oil facilities that we've been striking. so they were queued up there waiting to take on their illicit oil. ... so these trucks were — they were just sitting there, not moving.""it was an extraordinary opportunity to take out somewhere between one-quarter and one-third of the islamic state's entire truck fleet. and after destroying <NUM>, the americans ran out of ammunition. the remaining <NUM> trucks were not destroyed.beyond the out-of-ammo problem, reporters raised the issue of the u.s. forces' extreme care in avoiding civilian casualties. if american forces won't hit any target if there is any fear that any non-isis person might be harmed, might that not prolong the time it takes to destroy the islamic state, which is killing civilians right and left?""is there a catch-<NUM> about not striking civilians and avoiding civilian casualties when, over the past year, the $<NUM> million in oil revenue generated has been going to killing a large number of civilians?"" a reporter asked. ""is there any risk that avoiding civilian casualties is actually prolonging more civilian casualties?""that was a very thoughtful question, warren conceded, and an issue american war planners think about constantly. but warren didn't have an answer.

(my apologies for the stupid error in my last column dating the constitution as <NUM>.) we may have to face this real crisis again, but won’t have to write new documents this time. we need only to enforce the ones we already have - the ones that the obama regime is determined to ignore or overrule.when our founding fathers declared their independence from the king of england, they claimed “taxation without representation.” today we are being victimized and oppressed by the obama regime for the same reason. our money is being taken and nothing we want is being provided in return. on the contrary, they are using it for things we emphatically oppose, and strapping our citizens with unconscionable debt. they are grabbing every dollar and every ounce of credit they can to spend this country into insolvency.now they want to increase the national debt ceiling from <NUM>.<NUM> trillion to <NUM> trillion just to cover the entitlement programs already on the books until after the coming november <NUM> elections, in spite of obama‘s <NUM> statement on the senate floor: “raising america’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.” the current national debt is at <NUM>.<NUM> trillion, and at the current rate of spending, the <NUM>.<NUM> trillion ceiling will be reached in january.adding another trillion to the debt ceiling would last only until <NUM> months before the next election. that wouldn’t be good for democrat re-election chances so if they increase it now by <NUM>.<NUM> trillion, they hope no one will notice or if they do, they won’t remember next november. this additional debt should last until the end of <NUM>, well after the elections.the socialists have done nothing, absolutely nothing, to reduce the budget, the national debt, or their spending. even the tarp loan payback money that banks have repaid to the government - which was supposed to go back into the treasury to help reduce the deficit - has been stolen by the obama regime and diverted to his government job creation program. or in other words, to his environmental and union supporters and other special interest lobbies.moody’s investors service says the u.s. and u.k. may loose their triple-a credit rating by <NUM> “if economic growth lags, interest rates rise and the government fails to shrink the deficit or recover its loans to the financial sector.” obama professes that he can solve the problem of government overspending with dramatic increases in government overspending. he prides himself on removing $<NUM> million from a $<NUM>.<NUM> billion wasteful spending bill. this is insane.so in a year from now, when the debt reaches <NUM> trillion, what then? just do it again? where does it end? what is the end game? when will the goal of a cloward-piven financial collapse finally be realized? will it happen before the next election?how long will it be before this imitation president declares to the country that the government has no choice but to take over all private sector business and industry, and consequently redistribute the wealth, in order to “save the country” - or is it to “save the planet?” closer to the truth would be to secure permanent political power for the socialist left. if you haven’t recognized it by now, that is the end game. we call it communism.we now have two systems working against each other: a government socialist system competing against the private sector capitalist system. who will hold these tyrants accountable to the constitution and to the people? only the voters can, if it’s not too late by next november and in <NUM>. unfortunately, this regime has nearly a half trillion dollars of our money unspent from tarp and stimulus to use as they wish to make sure that doesn’t happen.those who laid our constitutional foundation were very clear about its limits on government. our constitution’s principle author, james madison, wrote, “the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined and will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation and foreign commerce.”concerning the legislature’s authority, thomas jefferson asserted: “giving congress a distinct and independent power to do any act they please which may be good for the union, would render all the preceding and subsequent enumerations of power completely useless. it would reduce the whole constitution to a single phrase, that of instituting a congress with power to do whatever would be for the good of the united states; and as sole judges of the good or evil, it would be also a power to do whatever evil they please. certainly, no such universal power was meant to be given them. the constitution was intended to lace them up straightly within the enumerated powers and those without which, as means, these powers could not be carried into effect.”madison added, “if congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money, and will promote the general welfare, the government is no longer a limited one, possessing enumerated powers, but an indefinite one, subject to particular exceptions.”if you quoted these verses to those in power today, they would think you were nuts. madam pelosi as much as said so when asked to state constitutional authority for her healthcare bill. others in congress had similar reactions and none could answer the question. the don’t believe in the constitution or the limits it places on their powers.this is not the government created by our founding fathers - this is not the government the american people want. the replacement constitution these people are creating is not the constitution our armed forces are sworn to protect and defend. when did hugo chavez become president of the united states under the name of barack obama? whose side will the military be on when push comes to shove? i think they well know who supports them and who doesn’t. and they know the constitution they swore an oath to

government is usurping the rights of homeowners and local officials, while causing harm to low-income families who are deprived of the real help they need to succeedhow hud makes lousy programs look greatwhen federal agencies promote programs, like affirmatively furthering fair housing, or common core they conduct sophisticated and often deceptive marketing campaigns that cover up there downsides. flowery slogans like, “transportation options are fundamental to having a shot at the american dream,” and “economic diversity is the path to better outcomes for all american children,” may sound moving. the truth about the programs is often disturbing. the department of education (used) and dot use the above phrases to market a federal scheme to regionalize and densify communities by shuffling students to new communities in the name of “income diversity.” (id is the government’s buzzword for a student’s path to success.)whether their programs are to “protect the environment”, (regional sustainable development,) develop “college and career ready” children (common core,) or create a platform to “improve adult outcomes” (hud’s affh,) agencies pump up the benefits to the uninitiated public, with little regard for the destructive effects of their plans. if a private business engaged in similar deceptive practices as our government, the consumer financial protection bureau would probably fine them out of business. unfortunately, consumers have little protection against federal dishonesty. with a dysfunctional congress and a disturbingly powerful executive, it is up to informed citizens working with local public officials to protect our own interests. here are four common ways our government deceives the american people. cherry-picked reports when federal agencies start projects the public may reject, they often cite research studies proving the wisdom and importance of their program. this “research” also demonstrates the agency’s professionalism and due diligence. but their studies often are little more than weak justifications for programs that frequently cause more harm than benefit to communities and to the intended beneficiaries. one example is hud’s “move to opportunity” (mto), a revived <NUM> “randomized social experiment,” that transferred low-income families into higher income areas to improve access to better education and jobs.a <NUM> hud report revealed the mto program did reduce the incidence of “extreme obesity” and “major depression” among the randomized families. but, according to the analysis, after <NUM> years, the project “failed to improve education, employment or income outcomes.” food stamp usage rose and, “males in the experimental group were arrested more often than those in the control group, primarily for property crimes, and were also more likely to engage in a variety of other delinquent and risky behaviours.” the blatant failures did not dissuade hud who has now reintroduced the program. since <NUM>, a series of new studies micro-analyzed the original results, each finding a positive nugget among the dismal results. finally, an august <NUM> report, “effects of exposure to better neighborhoods”, concluded that, under mto, children below the age of <NUM> earned more money, were more likely to attend college, and the girls were less likely to become single mothers. the “groundbreaking” study virtually ignored the negatives from the original research and wasted few sentences on the plights of children over <NUM> who reported “lower incomes” and worse outcomes than had they never moved. hud officials also disregarded the report’s most critical observation that, “the mto experimental design cannot be used to conclusively establish that childhood exposure to a better environment has a causal effect on long-term outcomes…” hud is proceeding with a program that, after <NUM> years, researchers can show no conclusive proof works. there are broader concerns. the administration ignores aggressive pursuit of methods to reduce the incidence of single parent families, and increase local educational opportunities, even though researchers recognize both as solutions to improving educational outcomes that are more important than incomes. is hud even within its legal bounds? hud is advancing the mto program under its affirmatively furthering fair housing rule. yet, nothing in the fair housing act entitles hud to transfer people to gain income integration, nor engage in many of the actions they are taking under affh.continued below... hear no research, see no research hud and the department of education believe poor student performance is primarily the result of living in concentrated areas of poverty. to remedy this, the agency intends to relocate low-income families to better neighborhoods to improve educational and income outcomes. to a low-income family, this seems like a boon. who would not want to move to a nicer area, especially if someone else is paying for it? but, to conclude that moving to affluent areas is the best solution to improve outcomes, hud had to ignore volumes of research findings that prove location is not the prime driver of scholastic ability. moving families to locations where adults and children have no friends or relatives in areas they cannot afford, brings its own challenges. the <NUM> study, “the effects of poverty on academic achievement” concludes that income and a mother’s level of education are the significant factors in determining educational outcomes. “in many studies, mother’s education had a more significant effect on children’s scores than income.” the author’s recommend that “instructional techniques and strategies can help close the achievement gap by providing students with necessary assistance in order to achieve high standards in academic performance.” there is no recommendation to uproot families and move them to more affluent areas. a <NUM> study, sponsored by the prestigious harvard program on education policy and governance, and education next, reveals that a child’s educational disadvantages are more the result of their parents’ educational levels than where they live. “among students from families with low parental education, u.s. literacy proficiency is a disastrous <NUM> percent, far below the <NUM> percent mark reached by students with high parent education.” while pursuing income diversity, hud ignores that the best way to improve grades and opportunities is not to shuffle families into new neighborhoods, but to educate families about the importance of two-parent households, the effects of fathers on children’s education, and the value of education for all family members. instead, hud, dot and the department of education are moving ahead with regional equity assistance centers as part of president obama’s stronger together program, (see page <NUM>) to teach local educators how to attain income diversity in classrooms as a means to improve educational outcomes. twisted logic economic mobility is the reasoning behind one of the administration’s most aggressive programs to relocate low-income families into better areas. it sounds reasonable, but ignores the real causes of economic immobility and deprives the next generation of the mental tools necessary to compete and succeed. economic mobility is the ability of individuals to move up and down the earnings ladder. greater mobility is associated with job opportunities, wealth accumulation and personal freedom. at one time, americans easily migrated from the poor to the middle class, but since the <NUM>’s this has slowed until today, the u.s. is one of the least economically mobile of all first world nations.the main causes for our immobility are technological advances that reduced the need for many middle income positions; and more importantly, a recession recovery that added high paying jobs for the upper class, and service oriented work for low-income brackets, but little for the middle class. with fewer middle class opportunities, the poor are stuck with nowhere to advance.the administration is right to conclude that economic mobility is a factor of success. but that success requires organic mobility, not federally mandated mobility. desiring, striving and overcoming whatever disadvantages there may be is all part of the success model.to help poor families improve, hud-used-dot wants to relocate schoolchildren in the elementary and secondary grades to gain economic diversity in each classroom. in an accompanying program, small area fair market rents, hud families will find their section <NUM> vouchers reduced in lower income zip codes and raised in wealthier neighborhoods, forcing them to move to more affluent areas, regardless of their wishes.the president touts this misguided program as “fundamental” to children’s success. the rationale is akin to the absurd conclusion that, “well-to-do families drive bmw’s, therefore, if we buy beamers for low-income families, they too will share the success of the higher earners.” under this logic, you could even provide a study proving that the owners of their new subsidized bmw’s are more psychologically content, arrive at work faster, and return home early enough to spend more quality time with the family and help the kids with their schoolwork. you can fool some of the people, all of the time government agencies frequently mislead local public officials and the public by including wording in their documents that implies the opposite of what the regulation actually accomplishes. a case in point is the administration’s affirmatively furthering fair housing rule that utilizes the fair housing act to eliminate segregation and discrimination. while this seems like a good cause, in practice, the program does little to eliminate discrimination. it does impose aggressive oversight over community planning. during the regulatory comment period for affh, astute responders questioned hud’s “intrusion into local affairs and responsibilities,” particularly zoning. the agency released this comforting statement: “this rule does not impose any land use decisions or zoning laws on any local government.” (see page <NUM>) but the statement is deceptive. while hud does not directly impose land use decisions or zoning laws, indirectly they can force you to impose them. as this community discovered, through charges of failure to affirmatively further fair housing, civil rights violations, threats to withdraw grant money and other legal actions, hud can coerce communities into compliance with their zoning requirements, even when the voters disagree. it would be nice to think the agency only uses their authority in the face of flagrant civil rights violations. that is not the case. in westchester county ny, in spite of being on-track to meet a court settlement requiring the county build <NUM> new affordable homes, the hud affiliated monitor wanted each community to adopt “model zoning ordinances.” at one point, the agency notified county executive rob astorino that ¼ acre building plots represented “exclusionary

outlook% of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents.headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!iraq’s oil history & outlook, part twoiraq is destined to become a regional if not global superpower based on the richness of its oil wealth. after all, this young democracy sits atop the world’s second-biggest reserves of high-quality petroleum.iraq’s future seems bright indeed. regardless of the current political squabbling, the oil-fueled iraqi economy continues to grow rapidly. it’s perennially rated as one of the world’s top ten fastest-growing economies, and there’s plenty of room for additional expansion.still, in order to see the clearest view of what the iraqi economy may look like in five or ten years, it’s helpful to take a look at the history of iraq’s oil industry as well as new oilfield technologies that are increasing iraqi production and revenues.in part one, we looked at the history of iraq’s oil-based economy as well as the political and economical developments leading up to the rise of saddam hussein and his control of the nation’s economy.now let’s take a look at iraq’s oil industry and current economic outlook, particularly what they mean for the value of the iraqi dinar, beginning with the turning point of the coalition invasion in <NUM> which ousted saddam.the beginning of the end for saddamthe u.s.-led invasion and occupation of iraq quickly ended saddam hussein’s ruthless <NUM>-year regime, and it was also the beginning of a new era for iraq’s long-neglected oil industry.with saddam and his cronies gone, the nation soon entered a period of unprecedented economic growth fueled by its booming oil industry.once the dust settled after the <NUM> invasion, american, european and middle eastern oil companies quickly arrived, ready for business. there was much work to be done.oil industry infrastructure in the kurdish region of northern iraq was relatively unscathed by actual fighting during war.still, oilfield equipment and facilities there suffered from years of neglect due to the shortage of replacement parts and new technologies made unavailable by the years of un-imposed trade embargo and economic sanctions.in southern and central iraq, the scene was different: between the gulf war of <NUM> and the fighting during <NUM>, approximately <NUM>% of the oil production and refinery facilities in those regions were damaged.apart from the impact of economic sanctions and war, saddam himself stunted the country’s oil industry even further by mandating reservoir-management policies which resulted in lower production for several years after his departure.wells were over-pumped, which in some cases permanently reduced their future outflows. and, in an attempt to boost yields lagging because of equipment maintenance issues, the iraqi engineers reinjected excessive amounts of low-end petroleum fractions back into the ground.reinjection is a standard industry technique for increasing a well’s output. however, the iraqi petroleum engineers reinjected overly-viscous oil constituents back into some wells, which slowed output for several years after saddam’s departure.huge reserves compensate for misstepsregardless of the mismanagement under saddam, the fact that iraq’s overall oil production has soared since his departure illustrates the enormity of iraq’s reserves and the resiliency of its industry.in spite of thirty years of bungling, iraq has been steadily achieving higher oil production totals almost every year since saddam’s demise.according to conservative estimates dating to <NUM>, iraq is believed to have at least <NUM> billion barrels of oil remaining to be tapped, and several more-recent estimates have nearly doubled this figure.geographically, most of iraq’s known petroleum reserves lie in a belt that runs roughly north and south along the eastern side of the country. iraq has at least <NUM> fields known to be “super giants” (minimum <NUM> billion barrels each) and another <NUM>+ “giant” fields (minimum <NUM> billion barrels each).leading petroleum engineers have indicated that southeastern iraq’s cluster of super-giant fields is the world’s largest concentration of such fields, accounting for about <NUM>% of the country’s reserves. the remaining <NUM>% of known reserves are found in the northern region of kirkuk, khanaqin and mosul.and, there seems to be plenty of room for more oil discoveries – iraq is unique because only a tiny fraction of its known reserves are under development, even though it already exports enormous amounts of crude oil. as development continues, more oil gushes forth.in fact, since <NUM> only about <NUM>,<NUM> wells have been drilled throughout iraq. in comparison, approximately one million wells have already been drilled in the state of texas alone.iraq is also “full of gas.” the country’s proven reserves of natural gas are approximately <NUM> trillion cubic feet, which is the fifth-largest in the world. about two-thirds of these known gas reserves are located in southern iraq, and the rest in the north.back to workin any event, as soon as saddam was gone the iraqi oil industry began returning to normal. during the years between <NUM> and <NUM>, iraq was busily repairing both its civilian infrastructure damaged by the war as well as upgrading its long-neglected oilfields.in <NUM> the iraqi government announced a new plan to work with the world’s largest oil companies – shell, exxonmobil, bp and total, who were the original partners in the iraq petroleum company (ipc) dating back to <NUM>.this plan was quickly replaced by an even larger, more comprehensive plan to develop iraq’s oilfields. in <NUM> the iraqi ministry of oil formally awarded service contracts to these original “big oil” companies as well as several other international firms including chevron.the oilfields under contract for development include iraq’s “super-giant” fields: halfaya, majnoon, west qurna, and rumaila. the china national petroleum corporation (cnpc) and bp won the contract to develop the rumaila field, which is iraq’s largest single field.as a result of these agreements iraq was able to increase its production dramatically. by <NUM> iraq had risen from near-zero production at the end of saddam’s reign to become the world’s twelfth-largest producer.in <NUM> the u.s. government allocated $<NUM> billion to help develop and modernize the iraqi oil and gas industry, although its direct involvement in managing that industry ended in <NUM>.by the end of <NUM> iraqi oil production had risen to nearly <NUM>.<NUM> million barrels per day. then, in <NUM> another milestone was reached: production averaged <NUM>.<NUM> million barrels per day, a level not achieved since <NUM>.in <NUM> a brief glitch arose when the kurdistan regional government (krg) seized control of several northern oilfields in a dispute with the central government in baghdad regarding revenues.fortunately, in early <NUM> was at least temporarily resolved, and oil flows have returned to normal since then.newer technologies boost iraqi outputas of <NUM>, iraqi oil production is already benefiting from new technologies which had been unavailable during the years of the un trade embargo.during the past few years these newer technologies have been introduced into iraq by the international oil companies that have been using such methods to increase oilfield yields in other countries. given iraq’s huge reserves, the nation’s oil industry will certainly to gain the maximum benefit from these technologies.the most important new technologies are directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing, both of which promise to help boost iraqi production and exports significantly.directional drillingbefore the <NUM>s, most wells were drilled vertically. that is, a hole was drilled straight downward until it reached oil, or not.then, in <NUM> several drilling companies developed techniques for slant drilling, which was an early form of directional drilling that allowed the hole to be drilled at a slight angle.directional drilling equipment allows a drill bit to move in a curving line rather than a straight line, so it can snake its way around underground obstacles such as unusually hard rock formations. in fact, given enough depth, wells can be drilled horizontally, that is, parallel to the surface of the land above.the first practical benefit of directional drilling is that it allows drillers to reach oil reservoirs several miles away from the site of the drilling rig. current technology allows drillers to drill as far as <NUM> miles away laterally.so, for example, directional drilling allows land-based rigs to drill in offshore locations, which significantly reduces production expenses. and, oil located under steep mountains can likewise be tapped from nearby flatlands.most importantly in iraq, directional drilling allows producers to increase the length of underground pipe exposed to the reservoir.instead of simply having the very end of the pipe inserted into an oil reservoir, with directional drilling a fairly long perforated section of the pipe is placed in contact with the oil.this is critically important for ensuring high flows once a well is completed, since oil can be sucked in through a much larger surface area.in iraq directional drilling enables producers to overcome the sluggish flows which had resulted from saddam’s policy of over-drawing oil from wells and then reinjecting thick, undesirable residues back into the ground in hopes of obtaining short-term increases in flow, as mentioned above.and, directional drilling also makes it possible for multiple wellheads to draw oil from a single drilling site, so the extended length of perforated pipe exposed to the oil in the reservoir means greater yields.likewise, directional drilling also allows a single wellhead to draw oil and/or gas from within several different geologic strata (layers of rock) at different depths, something which is impossible with older perpendicular drilling methods.the introduction of directional drilling technologies has helped iraq dramatically increase its production, and these technologies hold the promise of even greater yields in the future.hydraulic fracturinghydraulic fracturing, sometimes also called fracking, is a method for stimulating wells to produce more oil. the effectiveness of fracking was discovered during a series of experiments in <NUM>, and the first commercial application came in <NUM>.although some communities in the u.s. have debated the use of fracking for our domestic production, in iraq the practice is a potential godsend because it may allow oil producers to significantly increase their wells’ outputs.water containing a suspension of sand and other constituents is injected under high pressure down into a well in order to create cracks in the oil-bearing rock. these cracks allow oil to flow more freely within the underground reservoir, and therefore more can be extracted.a hydraulic fracture is created underground by pumping the fracturing fluid into the wellbore in order to increase the underground pressure enough to crack rock. as the rock cracks, the fracturing fluid continues onward, extending the cracking further and further.fracking equipment can operate at pressures and flow rates of up to <NUM>,<NUM> pounds of pressure per square inch (psi) with inbound flows of fracking fluid as high as <NUM> barrels per minute.sand and other materials called proppants are added to the fracking fluid in order to “prop open” the cracks already created, so they won’t close while the oil is flowing outward. these propped-open fractures allow oil and gas trapped within rock to more easily flow outward.it’s been estimated that fracking increases oil production by an average of about <NUM>%, and natural gas production by an average of <NUM>%.most importantly, when used together fracking and directional drilling have a synergistic effect – the yields with both together may be substantially higher than if each were used separately.the outlookgiven its huge oil reserves and the long-term commitments by international oil companies to develop its oil and gas fields, iraq is certain to have a bright economic future.as measured by its ever-increasing volume of oil exports, the country’s oil industry has fully recovered from the damage and mismanagement that it suffered during saddam hussein’s reign.notwithstanding iraq’s already-known reserves, it seems likely that recent new exploration efforts by oil companies will lead to an even greater tally of iraq’s oil wealth.it’s also important to note that iraq isn’t just blessed with large reserves, it also happens that the geologic formations holding iraq’s oil are much more accessible to drilling than they are in most countries, which means the costs of extracting that oil are much lower.this is significant because iraq can profitably produce petroleum at prices of less than $<NUM> per barrel.in contrast, u.s. shale oil costs between $<NUM> to $<NUM> per barrel to produce, and even the most cost-effective wells in texas generally require a global oil price of at least $<NUM> per barrel in order to be profitable. so, iraq can afford to pump and sell oil at prices below those of most other producing nations.these production advantages have been visible during the recent saudi arabian oil-production war designed to bankrupt u.s. shale-oil producers. while oil producers in the u.s. and elsewhere have been severely impacted by the saudis’ overproduction, iraq continues to produce profitably.oil drives the iraqi dinargiven the world’s insatiable appetite for oil and gas, iraq’s dominant supply role is likely to become even stronger going forward. although it’s difficult to predict the future with certainty, it seems likely that sometime in the near future iraq will grow into a regional and international energy super-power based on its rich reserves.in fact, iraq seems on-track to replace saudi arabia as the region’s wealthiest, most-developed nation within the next few years.what does this mean for the dinar?a nation’s economy, as well as the value of its currency, depends on its natural resources. iraq’s exceptionally large oil reserves are like “money in the bank,” available to meet the young democracy’s needs as it continues to grow.eventually the value of the iraqi dinar should rise to reflect the true value of the country’s oil wealth. this seems likeliest to occur once the central bank of iraq (cbi) frees the dinar from the artificially-low value placed on it in <NUM> following the darkest days of saddam hussein’s regime.when that occurs, the strength of iraq’s economy will rapidly become obvious to all observers worldwide, not simply those few individuals who have taken the time to research it.in any event, knowledge is the key to success. to learn more about the status of the iraqi oil industry and how it affects the dinar, click below.currency liquidator’s iraqi dinar

free press for freemajority of the inspectors general find themselves unable to perform their duties to audit the federal governmentgovernment inspectors generals describe atmosphere of restricted accessinspectors general (yes, that’s the plural) are considered watchdogs for the government. their jobs primarily focus on “uncovering waste, fraud, and mismanagement”, which is an important function to keep government programs and agencies in check.a serious breach of trust is evident, therefore, when <NUM> of <NUM> inspectors general pen a letter to congress describing “serious limitations on access to records.” that’s <NUM>% of the total watchdogs who express such concerns. you can read the letter here: the letter takes aim at primarily three agencies: the general at the peace corps, the environmental protection agency, and the department of justice. these inspectors general “recently faced restrictions on their access to certain records available to their agencies that were needed to perform their oversight work in critical areas.” the restrictions were not limited to just those inspectors general; hence the overwhelming need to pen a letter to congress. the inspectors general described how other “inspectors general have, from time to time, faced similar obstacles to their work, whether on a claim that some other law or principle trumped the clear mandate of the ig act or by the agency’s imposition of unnecessarily burdensome administrative conditions on access. even when we are ultimately able toresolve these issues with senior agency leadership, the process is often lengthy, delays our work, and diverts time and attention from substantive oversight activities. this plainly is not what congress intended when it passed the ig act. the inspector general act of <NUM> is clear. the pertinent statute that relates to access is section §<NUM>: authority of inspector general; information and assistance from federal agencies; unreasonable refusal; office space and equipment. it patently states: (a) in addition to the authority otherwise provided by this act, each inspector general, in carrying out the provisions of this act, is authorized— (<NUM>) to have access to all records, reports, audits, reviews, documents, papers, recommendations, or other material available to the applicable establishment which relate to programs and operations with respect to which that inspector general has responsibilities under this actthe full text of the law can be found here: the letter to congress was addressed to the honorable darrell issa, the honorable thomas r. carper, the honorable elijah cummings, and the honorable tom coburn. what made the letter particularly notable, however, was its size and scope. darrell issa described, “i’ve never seen a letter like this, and my folks have checked—there has never been a letter even with a dozen igs complaining. this is the majority of all inspectors general saying not just in the examples they gave, but government wide, they see a pattern that is making them unable to do their job.” reading the official website for inspectors general, one can see they pride themselves on service, “whose primary responsibilities, to the american public, are to detect and prevent fraud, waste, abuse, and violations of law and to promote economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the operations of the federal government.” the fact that the majority of the inspectors general find themselves unable to perform their duties to audit the federal government is quite troubling, because it is another example of the “most transparent administration” choosing to willfully cloak themselves in secrecy. stonewalling the very agents—who have a duty to the american people to keep government in check—is another tactical abuse of power.alan joel has been a practicing cpa in nyc for more than <NUM> years. he loves liberty and writes on the politics of taxes at his popular blog, alanjoelny.complease

broadcast about the onset of a new cold war since late <NUM>s because i saw the clinton administration’s intrusive policies and then yeltsin’s russia as generating a backlash that would lead the two countries to a replication or continuation of the <NUM>-year cold war that reagan and gorbachev and then the first president bush said they had ended in <DATE> and that has unfolded more or less in the worst ways that i worried about. i don’t think anybody would deny that they we’re in a new cold war. i think they’re slow in acknowledging that it’s even more dangerous in various ways and reasons than was the <NUM>-year cold war. but one reason is this was not the case during the old cold war is that we are militarily eyeball-to-eyeball with russia and on three new cold war fronts. one, of course, is ukraine which in a way is the epicenter but because of nato’s i think reckless military buildup on russia’s western borders particularly in the baltic regions region but also to a certain extent in syria where the situation is very fluid and still dangerous. the cold war could erupt into an actual hot war very easily. and i guess though the danger seemed maybe a year ago would be first and foremost in syria because ukraine since <NUM> seemed rather frozen. now it’s shifted back to ukraine. we’ve got to stop and think what that means. ukraine as a nation and then as a state following the end of the soviet union in <NUM> was always fraught with historical religious, ethnic, economic, and political divisions. simply holding ukraine together as a unitary state was going to be a problem but everyone managed. it wasn’t pretty but they managed until the events of <NUM> when we all remember the maidan protest and let’s remember what they were about…the legally-constitutionally elected president of ukraine, viktor yanukovych, declined to sign a so-called european union partnership agreement. it was just said to be civilizational and economic and it was said that that would bring ukraine into european civilization and of course away from russia. now ukraine and russia had been bound at the hip. people don’t mention this often but there are tens of millions of intermarriages. it’s hard not to go to moscow and spend some time and not find someone who’s got a ukrainian and russian parent or grandparent. but this happened and it also needs to be removed reminded that yanukovych did not refuse to sign that agreement. he simply asked for more time. but that set off protests driven by all sorts of people. some benign democratic seeking liberals, fine people in ukraine, but also by people who were by any definition ultra-nationalists and even quasi-fascist neo-nazis. and that led of course to the confrontation where yanukovych was driven illegally off. a new, illegal government was formed backed by the united states and europe. russia for various reasons that i think were legitimate feared that the unrest would spread to the historical russian peninsula of crimea which for most of its history for centuries had been part of russia. but because of a kind of fluke, was now territorially part of ukraine. the russians therefore welcomed and encouraged a referendum in crimea. by all standards including gallup polls that were taken later, more than <NUM> percent voted to join russia. and so russia legally annexed in <NUM>…they don’t call it annex, they call it reunited with crimea. meanwhile, the mostly russian provinces of donbass, part of crimea objected to the coup in kiev that had overthrown the president. they had voted for yanukovych. his electorate was not only in southeastern ukraine but it was primarily there. so they believed that their president had been overthrown and a rebellion began backed by russia of course. and the war has gone on now nearly four years. the official number of dead is <NUM>,<NUM> but it’s surely many more and perhaps <NUM> million people who lived in southeastern ukraine have been displaced most of them gone to russia. incidentally, russia gets no credit for the very humanitarian way they have handled all these people, refugees who fled to russia. now of course it was easier because they were russian speakers. but a great many of them have rebuilt their lives. vocationally and in terms of their family in russia. and whether they’ll ever go back to ukraine is not clear. so that’s where the situation was kind of frozen. there was this agreement as you know called the minsk <NUM> agreement that all the european powers agreed to there. the president of ukraine, poroshenko, agreed to it and that putin agreed too for resolution of the crisis. and it called for two things…a cessation along a designated line of the fighting and kiev’s agreement that donbass would be given home rule. to remain within what would essentially be a federated ukrainian state. no one has ever suggested a better or alternative solution to that. during the years since minsk was formalized in <NUM>, by all evidence it seems both sides have violated the agreement. but kiev has refused to grant any home rule to the rebel provinces and that we know from history whether it’s from the irish civil war or other diverse countries is the only way to save a state is to make it a federation. but the opposition to it in ukraine among ultra-right is enormous. president poroshenko is weak both as a person and as a leader and in terms of his public support at home. the united states has done nothing to encourage the real implication of minsk. and so it remains this hot front. and one could imagine all sorts of bad outcomes because it’s now a proxy war in donbass that is the rebels were backed by russia. kiev is backed by the united states and that proxy war could become a direct war. and a final point and this has been long winded but when is that ever since obama was trying to figure out what to do about ukraine. the idea of the united states sending more and higher quality weapons to kiev. to presumably suppress the rebellion in donbass though formally it said to ward off a new russian attack of which there is no evidence or intention. obama refused to do it (send heavy weapons). he was under enormous pressure especially from the liberal wing of the democratic party which has become very hawkish and he refused to do that. it seemed clear from donald trump’s campaign that he would never do it because he wanted to cooperate with russia. and yet he has been compelled i think to agree to send weapons to kiev when and what they’ll send isn’t yet clear but he can only make matters worse really matters worse. and that’s where we are today.the discussion then turns to the present day.the narrative in the west is that russia seized crimea as some sort of post-soviet expansion, where putin must be stopped as he is desperately trying to recreate the borders of the old soviet union. at tfmr, we have always felt that this was bogus and that it failed to acknowledge any context from the russian point of view.professor cohen resumes:the situation from the russian point of view was even worse. i mean crimea…and for to understand this you have to know russian history, know russians and know crimea…crimea historically, culturally was such a part of russia for so many centuries right through the soviet period that it would be….this is a bit of a stretch as if to say that texas because it once belonged to mexico…was not authentically, indigenously a native part of america. but even more because the cultural romance of crimea. the site, i mean the home of chekov’s dacha was in yalta. it’s iconic in russian history, russian culture and russian sentiment. it wasn’t just the naval base at sebastopol which was vitally important, although the russians which had been leasing the naval base and by the way what happened at maidan called into question whether kiev would honor that long term lease any longer. you’re absolutely right about that. russia was building in the far north an alternative naval base. i mean technically it could have replicated crimea strategically it could have done this but it could never have replicated crimea in the hearts and minds of russians. and, as poll after poll and the referendum showed in the hearts and minds of some <NUM> percent of the crimean people. now crimea also has tartar crimeans and ukrainians who don’t share this view. but the overwhelming majority of crimeans who were born there or moved there or lived there for decades, that was their sentiment. now here’s the political background. nonetheless in all the years i’ve followed post soviet russia, beginning in <NUM>, i never saw any kremlin leadership give any indication that it was going to take crimea back. let me repeat that. you could not find, certainly not in the public record…who knows what…dreams…you know these kinds of people have in the pentagon and elsewhere secretly in the dark of the night. but neither yeltsin nor putin ever gave any public support to the idea which you could find in moscow and some intellectual circles that you know, crimea is ours. in fact, at one point they needed to draw new maps because crimea was now no longer in russia after <NUM>. and putin wrote to the president of crimea…i don’t recall which one it was saying “hey our map people want to get on with the new maps could you get your map people to work with them because there’s a number of borders that aren’t clear and we’ve got to clarify them”. and he got no response. in other words, the notion that crimea might be taken or even negotiated back into russia simply was not on the political agenda for the kremlin under putin until <NUM>.the final segment of the discussion deals with the future . +more specifically, what if anything can be done by you and i…regular everyday people…to effect change and divert the war party from this path of destruction?professor cohen had some thoughts there, too.i’m not a trump supporter and i didn’t vote for him. however, we can actually support donald trump’s campaign promise which i think he’s tried to act on since he’s been president that it’s necessary to cooperate with russia. this is what was called detente in the <NUM>th century. i don’t know why trump doesn’t make this point. i don’t think he has very good advisors in regard to russia either in terms of what’s going on in russia or in terms of his own policy making but trump might say in his own defense because they’re indicting him for simply saying i want to cooperate with russia and with putin in particular. he could say look, every republican president of consequence in the <NUM>th century pursued detente with russia. first eisenhower, the first detente the spirit of camp david with khrushchev, then the nixon kissinger attempt at a grand detente with brezhnev and finally above all ronald reagan a detente with gorbachev the last soviet leader soviet russian leader so great that reagan and gorbachev ended the cold war. trump could put himself in that tradition and say “i’m the traditional republican. this is what eisenhower, nixon and reagan did. they did it wisely. they avoided nuclear war with russia. we’re in a new cold war. the dangers are grave. it’s not only my duty as the american president to pursue cooperation to ward off a catastrophe but i commend the honorable tradition of the republican party”. he doesn’t say that. i don’t know why as i say it because he doesn’t know what or because he wants to be the one and only i have no idea what he needs to say. and if he said it it would compel a conversation in washington that we’re not having. what’s happened to detente and what’s happened is we have if we ignore his own idiom and put it in again i speak as a story in the historical language of <NUM>th century diplomacy. we have a pro-detente president who for the first time in history is not permitted to at least try because every time he has a sensible conversation with putin, no matter whether it’s face to face or on the telephone, he’s accused not only by the traditionally crazies in american politics but by the new york times of treason. so what we could do and it will be hard for a lot of people because of the loathing for trump. is so pervasive just and i didn’t vote for trump is the fifth amendment i didn’t vote for trump and i didn’t support president trump. but about this he is not only right. he’s our only hope at the moment. so one possibility is simply to say no matter all else we support donald trump’s attempt to cooperate with russia because it’s existential. now would enough of us do that would a few newspapers do that? would a few of these cable tv panelists? would they ever have panelist on who would do that? we might affect a little civic courage in congress where a few people there would do so also. but at the moment you have a complete blackout on this perspective in the american political media arena and you have an utter lack of civic courage among political figures and editors who know better but have been frightened by this rush to do business unfortunately and that’s a pretty good summation.obviously, at <NUM> minutes, there’s a lot more information here than what i’ve transcribed. therefore i beg you, please take the time this weekend to listen to this full podcast. then, when you’re finished, please forward the audio to someone you know.only through some sort grassroots dialogue will we be able to prevail against the war party and their march toward confrontation with russia.as professor cohen states, we face a very real and existential threat from this new cold war. we must do all we can do to stop it before it becomes an out-of-control, hot war.source:

franchise on enlightened thinking, i have often been asked how in the world i could have voted for a (fill in the progressive blank) like george w. bush for president. remarkably, the answer to that question is one that seems to have eluded most of these deep thinkers. “you mean how could i have voted for george w. bush—as opposed to a hypocritical scold like al gore, or a self-aggrandizing blowhard like john kerry?” i invariably respond.unless you’ve has been living in an alternative universe, you’re well aware of the avalanche of criticism directed at donald trump from all quarters, liberal and conservative, including the latest hypocritical screed by mitt romney. yet despite that criticism, virtually everyone engaged in it ignores the essential reality that attends every election: context is everything. in other words, whatever one feels about donald trump, or any other candidate for that matter, the ultimate question and the answer to it cannot be postponed indefinitely, as in donald trump—running against whom?unfortunately, john kerry remained true to his appetite for power, and thus the american public remains afflicted with a secretary of state who needs “additional evaluation” undertaken before he can decide if the wholesale and systematic slaughter of christians in the middle east constitutes “genocide.” a man who, when informed that a former gitmo detainee had returned to terrorism, epitomized the utter clueless of the entire obama administration’s foreign policy. “he’s not supposed to be doing that,” kerry stated.that being said, there is little doubt in my mind that a commander-in-chief al gore or john kerry would have been worse leaders by several orders of magnitude. gore had the decency to take his global warming hustle into the private sector, where he made millions selling christian-like dispensations known as “carbon credits” to the terminally gullible.unfortunately like his father, george w. believed maintaining comity with his democrat detractors was apparently more important that defending the most momentous decision any commander-in-chief must make. reneging on his no new taxes pledge to accommodate democrats—who savaged him in return—probably cost george h.w. bush the <NUM> election. george w.’s flaccid response to reid and company gave us a democratically-controlled congress in <NUM>—and paved the way for the rise of barack obama in <NUM>.let’s be clear here. this is neither a ringing endorsement for what bush accomplished, nor a knock on what i perceived as his major failings, the foremost of which was allowing democrats to co-opt the iraq war narrative without any substantive pushback. when american men and women are in harm’s way, allowing a slanderous hack like harry reid to declare the war “lost” even before the ultimately successful surge was completed, was an unconscionable and unnecessary surrender.it is pretty clear that eight years of the obama administration’s effort to “fundamentally transform the united states of america” into a socialist utopian paradise, with a third world underpinning that millions of illegals represent, has enraged millions of americans. maybe even to the point, as so many of trump’s critics point out, where anger and frustration has completely supplanted anything resembling rational thinking.anger and frustration about what? how about a gop establishment that has made an utter mockery of their base’s support and is now in the process of going after that base’s preferred candidate with the kind of vigor and viciousness they have never directed at at barack obama or hillary clinton?moreover, what in the world do they think would happen if they purposely orchestrate a brokered convention where none of the current presidential candidates get the nomination? they have to know that the number of conservatives who stayed home when milquetoast mitt “polited” his way to defeat would be dwarfed by the number who would stay home if an establishment gop candidate were force-fed to the base. thus an inescapable conclusion arises:the establishment gop would tolerate a president hillary clinton to maintain their control of the party—even if they run the party into the dustbin of history as a result.that would be the same hillary clinton, who believes the rule of law applies to everyone else but her and her husband. the same hillary clinton who left four americans to die in benghazi and then lied about a video being the cause of their demise when her own communications with her daughter, egyptian prime minister hisham kandil and the libyan president on the night of the attack indicated she knew otherwise. a women who still can’t explain at the very least how highly-classified emails “migrated” from wholly secure and self-contained government servers to her personal one. a woman with no discernible accomplishments as a senator, and a track record of colossal failure as secretary of state.a woman who successfully used the sexist card to bash every republican, until trump came along and threw it right back in her predator-enabling face.make no mistake: this is not an endorsement of donald trump. i’m not a big fan of the palookaville style of politics, or the mud-wrestling into which the republican primary season has devolved. but if trump does make it to the finish line, and hillary is his opponent, then what? if it comes down to these two, who do you want picking the next supreme court justice—or three? who do you want formulating immigration policy? who has a better vision for our terminally-underperforming economy? who do you want defending america against islamist terror, iranian nuclear ambitions and russian and chinese military expansionism? who do you want restoring american exceptionalism, someone who might believe in it, or someone who clearly doesn’t?the electorate has long been forced to choose between the “lesser of two evils,” and there is little doubt this may very well prove to be the most pernicious choice in modern history. but it remains a choice nonetheless, maybe the most important one in a very long time. thus it behooves every would-be voter to keep context in mind, no matter how down and dirty the <NUM> presidential campaign becomes. in fact, context is all that ultimately matters.",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE>

un relief and works agency for palestinian refugees by more than $<NUM> million, but still gave the agency $<NUM> million. that’s $<NUM> million too much. unrwa has become the poster child for u.n. bureaucratic bloat, mission creep, and twisted morality.unrwa was founded in <NUM> to help palestinian refugees displaced by israel’s war of independence. even that decision was questionable. after all, putting israel’s creation aside, in the <NUM>s alone, wars created more than <NUM> million refugees. there was world war ii, of course, but the <NUM> partition of india also displaced <NUM> million persons and created millions of refugees. in the wake of israel’s creation, arab states expelled hundreds of thousands of their jews. this is why the u.n. created the united nations high commissioner for refugees to be the permanent agency charged with refugee assistance and protection.individual palestinian arab families suffered dislocation and tragedy, but they were hardly alone. they were alone, however, in having a u.n. agency created to cater specifically to them. still, when the u.n. created unrwa, it was meant to be a temporary agency to address a temporary problem. once it resettled palestinian refugees, its job was done and it was to shut its doors forever and dissolve.in a <NUM> report to the un general assembly, unrwa reported, “there must be a firm goal of terminating relief operations. sustained relief operations inevitably contain the germ of human deterioration.” it was right, but arab state rejectionism got in the way. arab states like egypt, syria, and iraq quickly concluded that they could use unrwa to perpetuate the problem, to undercut normalization with israel, and to transform an aid agency into a weapon against israel.the rest is history. both current unrwa commissioner general pierre krahenbuhl and unrwa spokesman chris gunness were born years after unrwa was meant to dissolve.nor does unrwa’s track record make it worth saving. while unhcr has resettled refugees and allowed them to get on with their lives, unrwa has actively undercut settlement. it has embraced a unique definition of refugee that differs with unhcr and that is used everywhere else in the world. consider: if india and pakistan used the same definition of refugee from their partition that unrwa embraces, there would be more than <NUM> million refugees in south asia today. unrwa has helped make the palestinians the largest per capita recipient of aid on earth, but has the least to show for it.the problem isn’t just waste of money, however. almost a quarter-century after the palestinian authority began, unrwa has eroded rather than supported the foundations of good governance. after all, if unrwa promises to take care of housing, education, and support, why shouldn’t both the palestinian authority and their sometime-partner hamas spend money on terror pensions, terror tunnels, and an arsenal of rockets?add into the mix unrwa incompetence: schools used as arsenals, school books teaching incitement, unrwa employees moonlighting as bomb makers, and terror recruitment in unrwa high schools and the problem is even worse. unrwa denials of complicity in such activities, if taken at face value, are just acknowledgment of its own poor oversight.it’s long past time to cut off unrwa and ask unhcr to take over. the palestinians deserve an apolitical agency rather than an amplifier for radicalism and waste. unrwa has become a cancer not only for those who seek peace and reconciliation, but also for the entire un system.unrwa in <NUM>

who intended to put them on the unemployment line come november. even more moderate sen. evan bayh (d) has announced his retirement, despite leading in the polls and $<NUM> million in his campaign war chest.putting a fine point on his reasons for leaving, bayh stated—“after all these years, my passion for service to my fellow citizens is undiminished, but my desire to do so by serving in congress has waned. for some time, i have had a growing conviction that congress is not operating as it should. there is too much partisanship and not enough progress—too much narrow ideology and not enough

tied up in dc gridlock like never before.nobody’s messiah nowobama can’t get a passing grade in any category today, and the pelosi led congress is even more unpopular than what’s left of the man who

sounding campaign rhetoric only to find out after inauguration day, that they had elected a marxist wrecking ball to power. the tea party represents most americans of all political stripes, though all constitutionally conscious and it can’t be hijacked or controlled by either political party. so, it must be put down!hence, news of the clintonistas cranking up the old war-room for an all-out counter-attack on the tea party movement demonstrates just how concerned the progressive left is, at a time when it appears that democrats are not only likely to be replaced with republicans, but constitutional conservatives…—god forbid!the heavy marxist hand of obama, pelosi and reid have certainly awakened the sleeping giant and carville and mcauliffe hope to put a choke-hold on the movement before millions of angry americans can successfully snuff out the current march to marxism (aka progress).meanwhile, even the most far left core supporters of the obama-nation movement have lost hope for the kinds of change they thought certain with control of all branches of the fed in their death grip.code pink is angry over obama’s surge in afghanistan, which might be the only correct thing he’s done since taking office, and the fact that he has made no progress in pulling out of iraq, a war that was “illegal” under bush, in the minds of code pinkos.moveon is so desperate for a “new messiah” that even rocker john cougar mellencamp offers more hope from his little pink house, than obama offers from the white house.international socialists demanding the closure of club gitmo and civil rights for known terrorists are disappointed that obama has dropped the ball on setting those terrorists loose after an oj simpson styled public lashing of the us military.nothing has gone well

in both a straight line and on curvesmitsubishi winter driving event helps teach control on snowwinter may be on its way outsoon, but there’s still enough of the “old person” around to ensure that snowy canadian roads will be challenging for at least a few more weeks. that means there’s still ample opportunity for more skid-related fender benders before spring springs and the grass starts rizzing. and to that end, mitsubishi canada has been on the road as well, bringing some professional drivers and some of their outlander suv/crossovers to alberta to not only showcase the “crummy weather capabilities” of their vehicles but to give some handy tips to attendees who find themselves oot and aboot when the white stuff sticks. i love these events; they’re not only fun but they can help you “navigate the neige” with more confidence and skill. i did a similar type of thing a couple of years back when ford came through and will always show up for such events because you can never have too much practice - and it’s a real hoot sliding around a snowy open area in someone else’s vehicle (and they treat you really nicely, too). so it was that mitsubishi and their folk, armed with a squadron of outlanders, came through calgary last saturday on the last leg of their three stop tour to wild rose country. they were accompanied as well by representatives from morrisport advanced driving, a group of personable driving experts with whom i’ve worked before as well.the event kicked off with a short presentation by morrisport’s lawrence howlett, who outlined what we could expect from the two hour session and then gave us some insight into such issues as proper seating position, the physics of vehicle control and the benefits of such technologies as traction control and abs, as well as mitsubishi’s systems of all wheel control there are actually two such systems - well, one’s an enhancement of the other - available on the outlander and given mitsubishi’s legendary record when it comes to rallying, the company appears to have gotten the technology down pat. the basic awc sends torque, when the vehicle’s electronic brain deems it necessary, from the front to the rear axle to help ensure good traction when the front wheels (the base model is a front driver - like many, many others in the suv/crossover market these days) start losing traction. the “super all wheel control” that’s available on the gt trim level ups that ante by adding torque vectoring between the front left and right wheels as well, for even better control when push comes to shove. both systems work well, as we noticed during the driving part of the event, but the bottom line as always is the proverbial nut behind the wheel, which meant the driving part of the experience was even more important because it gave us a chance to actually put the words into practice. and so we did! the event, held at calgary’s winsport complex (aka canada olympic park), had us navigate a slalom course initially, starting slowly and building up speed as we got comfortable. thanks to fresh snow it was plenty slippery, which of course worked to the benefit of the exercise, but the combination of mitsubishi’s awc systems and the expert guidance meant that very few cones were clobbered.from there, we did an acceleration and braking course - basically a straight line between cones during which we peeled out as much as possible on snow (surprisingly peelable, thanks to the mits technology), barrelled toward the braking zone, then tromped on the pedal. the first time was kind of tentative, then we got faster and more aggressive on the brake pedal to showcase not only the outlanders’ performance but also to show us the difference between braking with and without using the anti-lock brake system. i’ve always been of the opinion that if the traction control and/or abs comes on then you aren’t doing your job as a driver, but sometimes it’s nice to have the electronic robots on hand just in case. this is especially true these days; my first car with abs was an original generation infiniti q<NUM> with first generation abs and traction control and it was more annoying than useful, but those days appear to be long gone as technology has marched onward. from there, we went to a “fork in the road” event where we went like a bat out of hell toward said fork - laid out again with cones - the instructor waiting till the last minute to tell us if we should take the left or right fork, or stay in the middle and stand on the brakes. this not only taught us to listen and to pay attention, it also helped showcase the benefits of looking as far down the road ahead of you as possible so you’re ready for whatever might happen in front of you. the focus, as it should be, was on the importance of smoothness behind the steering wheel. not just smoothness on the wheel itself, though of course that’s critical, but smoothness on the pedals as well. sure, the nannies and awc can help a lot, but the bottom line as always is that the pilot in command is, indeed, in command and should take those responsibilities seriously.continued below... it reminds me of a line in the movie “contact,” where the young girl heroine is trying to find people to talk to on her ham radio. her dad tells her “small moves,” meaning basically that being smooth and gentle on the tuning knob would help. and it did: she ended up in an alien-designed space transport! it’s the same with driving. sure, there are times when a panic stop or swerve might be necessary, but the lion’s share of your time behind the wheel will be better and more efficient if you keep your eyes peeled on the conditions around you (and as far ahead as you can see) so that, if you do need to make some kind of course correction, you can do it with smaller, more controlled - and smoother - moves. racers such as the morrisport guys know and practice this and they helped attendees understand the concept before unleashing us to wreak our own special havoc on the snowy lot. the bottom line of the event is that it gave those of us who were there a chance to learn about and practice - in a limited manner under controlled conditions - optimal steering wheel control, vision and anticipation, as well as some obstacle avoidance and emergency braking tactics in both a straight line and on curves. you can do this on your own on any reasonably large, snow-covered parking lot. sure, you may not have the expert guidance we had during mitsubishi’s event, or a bunch of cones to lay out, but any practice is good practice and if you can learn to control your vehicle better by doing a few donuts after the mall has closed for the day, you’ll be more confident and more skilled when push really does come to slide in the real world. besides, it’s fun!jim publishes technofile magazine. jim is an affiliate with the automobile journalists association of canada and his careers have included journalist, technology

(related: the bogus “trump-russia collusion” story is nothing but a political hatchet job cooked up by obama loyalist john brennan.)it’s also worth noting that peter strzok was the fbi’s lead investigator on the investigation into hillary clinton’s mishandling of classified emails during her time as secretary of state. strzok even interviewed clinton on july <NUM>, <NUM>, just days before then-fbi director james comey announced that he would not be recommending any charges. if peter strzok is this biased and this willing to defend liberal democrats, why would robert mueller recruit him for his team?of course, peter strzok is only one of many individuals on robert mueller’s team that has an obvious left-wing slant. fbi deputy director andrew mccabe, for example, was involved in both the investigation into hillary clinton’s email server and the investigation into the uranium one sale, neither of which conveniently resulted in legal consequences for clinton. mccabe’s wife also received roughly $<NUM>,<NUM> from clinton supporters and left-wing organizations during her campaign for virginia state senate. other people on mueller’s team with liberal biases include andrew weissmann, justin cooper, jeannie rhee, bruce ohr, and others.if all of this isn’t enough to convince you that this entire investigation into russia’s role in the <NUM> presidential election is just a politicized witch hunt designed to destroy president trump and his administration, then what

differences of today’s leading two parties are not over ultimate questions of principles. rather, they’re over opposing answers to the question of how a goal can be achieved with the least sacrifice. for lawmakers, the goal is to promise the populace something for nothing while pretending to make good on it.take the latest tax bill, for instance. the gop wants to tax less and spend more. the democrat party wants to tax more and spend even more. we don’t recall seeing any proposals to tax less, spend less, and shrink the size of the state. and why would we?today’s central planners and social engineers are enlightened and progressive. they know much more about anything and everything than the rest of us. in particular, they share a general sense that they know how to spend your money better than you.at best, the central planners call your money to washington so they can then distribute it back to your friends and neighbors. in reality, the lawmakers call your money to washington where they distribute it to their friends and neighbors – not yours. this is not a matter of opinion. it’s a matter of fact.is it a coincidence that the top three wealthiest counties in the country are in the shadow of the capitol in the d.c. suburbs? what it is exactly that the residents of these counties do that’s of tangible value is unclear. however, what is clear is that bogus government jobs in loudoun county and fairfax county, virginia, pay big bucks. but that’s not all…garbage in garbage outfurther up the eastern seaboard, wall street has a good thing going too. the big bankers and brokers make big bucks extracting capital from main street america. that’s a fair characterization, right?perhaps the big bankers and brokers really are efficiently allocating capital to its highest and best use. who knows? but as far as we can tell, they’re gambling with other people’s money – and collecting fees regardless of how their coin tosses fall. it’s always, ‘heads i win, tails you lose.’ not a bad fugazi gig, if you can get it.of course, the cornerstone of it all is the federal reserve. through what they call “open market operations,” the fed rigs the game in washington’s and wall street’s favor. indeed, the process is really quite elegant.under the smokescreen cover of garbage in economic data, the fed’s economists produce garbage out bar charts and line graphs. these, in short, are fabricated depictions of the economy’s growth, consumer and producer prices, personal consumption expenditures, unemployment rate, and whatever other aggregate metrics are deemed to be of vital importance. what’s more, these fabricated depictions serve as the basis for the fed’s monetary policy decisions.do the graphs show price inflation heating up or cooling down? what about gdp or the unemployment rate? is one going up while the other’s going down? is one going down while the other’s going up?the federal open market committee (fomc) deliberates over these questions about every six weeks. then the fed goes to work inflating the nation’s money supply, with the occasional rug yank, for the stated purpose of getting the charts and graphs to illustrate the garbage data to their liking. what to make of it?the rug yank phase of fed policyfrom the outside, the fed’s economists and planners appear to be esteemed professionals, making decisions with the intent of providing for the greater good of the country. they even attend economic conferences and forums where they present their latest research findings on abstract topics like liquidity traps. some of their studies even include footnotes, as if the professional economists are building upon a concrete knowledge base of human intellect.yet beneath this cover of bogus science, the real sausage is made. capital is borrowed into existence where it is directed to washington and wall street. there, having first dibs on this phony money, washington and wall street get to spend it as if it has real value.however, the real value does not coming from the fed’s phony money. in fact, as this new phony money appears on the scene, it extracts incremental wealth from the workers and producers across the country that – through their time, talent, and labor – created the wealth to begin with.at the moment, we’re in the rug yank phase of the fed’s monetary policy. this is where they reel back credit ever so slightly after letting it run wild over the last decade. this tightening of credit markets has the effect of pulling the rug out from under financial markets and the economy.monetary policy, without question, is not an exact science. it’s rudimentary guess work that’s based on committee interpretations of bogus data. this week, the fomc raised the federal funds rate by <NUM>.<NUM> percent to between <NUM>.<NUM> and <NUM>.<NUM> percent. this marks the third increase this year and the fifth increase this cycle.incidentally, janet yellen also delivered her last press conference as chair of the federal reserve, though she’ll likely still chair the fomc meeting scheduled for late january. then jay “count dracula” powell will take over the helm of the nation’s central bank. the broad expectation is for powell to continue the rate increase playbook that yellen has laid out, which includes three quarter percent hikes in <NUM>.we wish powell the best in his endeavors. but we suspect he’ll unwittingly pull the rug out from under financial markets and the economy before he completes his first year. after that, the fun really begins.editor’s note: the only point i would add to this article is that the fed “rug rank” on financial markets is indeed taking place, as it is around the world with numerous central banks beginning a coordinated fiscal tightening policy, but it is far more likely that the international banking cabal is not oblivious to the effects of their own actions. in fact, it is more likely that they are pulling the rug out from under markets slowly,

newsconnecticut residents living near the state’s rivers and within specific watersheds may want to steer clear of the water sources as a recently published study in the journal of infectious diseases discovered a link between close proximity to waterways and increased number of legionnaires’ disease infections. the study carried out by a team of researchers at the yale school of public health, the yale school of forestry & environmental studies, and the connecticut department of public health was based on analyzed cases of non-outbreak legionellosis that required hospital admissions between jan. <NUM>, <NUM> and dec. <NUM>, <NUM>.data from the <NUM>-year study revealed that increased rainfall and stream flow were tied to an increase in legionnaires’ disease cases across the state. likewise, the research team found that natural water reservoirs played a central role on where people contract a respiratory disease called sporadic legionellosis. the scientists also observed that people living within <NUM> miles of the quinebaug river and the hockanum brook had the highest likelihood of contracting the disease. in contrast, those living near the saugatuck river in western connecticut and the shetucket river in eastern connecticut had the lowest odds of having the illness.according to the research team, the increase in disease rates may be explained by two things: bacterial aerosolization or residential water contamination. the scientists explained that water could be aerosolized by power plants and sewage treatment plants that use rivers during the cooling and treatment processes, which in turn can lead to immense bacterial proliferation. as a result, residential water supplies become more susceptible to contamination, thus increasing the risk of infection.“our findings demonstrate that the natural environment could have a greater role in influencing the risk of disease than previously thought. this contrasts with the common view that building water systems and cooling towers are the main source of exposure for many cases. rivers and watersheds could be proxies for areas of heightened risk due to poorly treated drinking water or well-water use. defining the mechanism behind the link between rainfall and legionellosis is a next step and likely requires more investigation of the role of drinking water on sporadic cases of disease and how rainfall can affect water quality,” lead author kelsie cassell said in a press release.however, the scientists noted that more research is warranted to better determine whether rainfall and river turbulence could exacerbate bacterial aerosolization or residential water contamination.cdc: legionnaires’ outbreaks in the u.s. increased nearly fourfold in <NUM> yearsa report by the centers for

cases carry a high price tag: the annual cost of treating legionnaires’ disease, based on hospital claims, is about $<NUM> million,” cdc director tom frieden told washington post online.according to

filers,"" the fda explained after it rolled out the system.gao analysts noted that predict was pretty good at flagging for physical examination those imported food items at higher risk of violating either safety regulations or labeling rules. however, there were two things the fda could do to make predict even more useful. one is to set up a documentation process to identify those open-source data, acquire these data and then determine how predict should use them.furthermore, new rules and programs set up under the food safety modernization act will result in more information for predict

provocation: open skies treaty faces hard timesheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!peter korzun / strategic culturethe open skies treaty (ost) is in jeopardy. signed in <NUM> and in force since <NUM>, the treaty, a fundamental trust-building measure, permits its <NUM> ratified member-states to conduct observation flights over one another’s territory while capturing aerial imagery of military personnel and materiel. the compliance is monitored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce). over <NUM>,<NUM> flights have been conducted worldwide through the treaty, which allots active and passive quotas to the signatory states based on the size of their territories. over the past <NUM> years, the us and russia have made a combined <NUM> flights.on dec. <NUM>, russian ministry of foreign affairs said russia limits the scope of us military observation flights over its territory starting from jan. <NUM>, <NUM>. moscow cancels overnight stops at three airfields for us observation planes, as well as scraps a number of bilateral agreements that were made to facilitate observation flights. the step is taken in response to us curbs on similar russian flights over hawaii and alaska coming into force on the first day of <NUM>. the restrictions are reversible and could be lifted if the us backtracked on its policies.in september, the us warned russia that the restrictions on flights over the kaliningrad region – a non-contiguous section of russian territory squeezed between lithuania, poland and the baltic sea – were seen as a violation of the treaty. russia restricted flights over the kaliningrad region because some parties to the treaty crossed the length and breadth of the flight path, causing problems in the use of the region’s limited airspace and to the kaliningrad international airport. it prompted moscow to restrict the maximum flight distance over the kaliningrad region to <NUM> kilometres without changing the total flight distance of <NUM>,<NUM> km and hence coverage of russia’s territory. the regulation does not run contrary to the ost or the signatories’ subsequent decisions. the flight range of <NUM> km is sufficient for observing any part of the region. the us, canada, turkey and georgia have established restrictions within the treaty on flying over their territories.russia has been accused of the unlawful denial to permit observation flights in the <NUM> kilometer border area of the so-called georgian regions of abkhazia and south ossetia. but the two entities are sovereign states recognized as such by russia. the open sky treaty states that the flights must not violate a ten-kilometer corridor along the border of another state.another accusation said moscow overused the force majeure provision to change the coordinated plans of observation flights due to flights made by the country’s leaders in close proximity to the planned paths of observation flights. but the provision was invoked only once.why the us has chosen to keep russian surveillance aircraft away from alaska and the hawaii? alaska is home to four air bases, three naval facilities, minuteman iii icbms sites. on november <NUM>, the military finished installing the <NUM>th ground-based interceptor (gbi) at the missile defense complex at fort greely, alaska, completing the deployment of <NUM> additional gbis ordered by president obama in <NUM>. hawaii is where united states air force hickam air force base and the naval station pearl harbor as well as pacific missile range facility are located.actually, it’s not a severe blow; russia can use satellites to observe these areas. but it’s a start. the restrictions could unleash a chain reaction to bury the treaty as part of a broader process of arms control erosion. for instance, georgia has closed its skies to russian observation flights in a clear and gross violation of the ost. it calls the <NUM> flights into question. the decision could be explained by the desire to conceal from observers the construction of military facilities.the open skies treaty continues to be a valuable instrument for security and stability at the time of arms control crisis. the ost enhances transparency and the risk of war. with the treaty in force, the us gains as much as russia but by having provoked moscow into taking retaliatory measures it has made one more step to make the world slide an unfettered arms

months, i and others have repeatedly warned that isis posed a special threat to western nations. we were often accused of scaremongering or warmongering. but then came last friday. and now that the war has come home — to the streets of a western city filled with sports fans and music fans and individuals celebrating democratic freedom — the debate is closed.isis is at war with the west. and it must be ended. of course, in the days ahead some will argue that we should keep “paris in perspective.” consider this weekend’s erudite assertions by the atlantic’s conor friedersdorf, who cautions against french retaliation because “ill-chosen wars can and do carry more costs than benefits.” this logic is grossly mistaken. today, as surely as at pearl harbor, the choice of war has been imposed by the enemy.from the relative sanctuary of its caliphate, isis has now invaded the west with arrogant glee. and although some will say that the terrorist threat remains small — that more people are killed by umbrellas than by terrorist attacks — this single attack of terrorism is an onslaught against our societal fabric. by murdering a range of individuals in a range of social settings and in a range of ways, isis is cultivating the belief that our lives are insecure.isis is cultivating the belief that our lives are insecure.however subtle, the gross chilling effect born of this terrorism must not stand. we must annihilate isis before it launches new attacks on our way of life. and in france, america now has a capable european ally with which to respond. although his domestic record is catastrophic , french president françois hollande has proven himself determined in foreign policy, deploying french military forces against al-qaeda syndicates in africa and challenging president obama to take a tougher stance against iran and syrian leader bashar al-assad. i expect hollande will show increasing fortitude in the days ahead.after all, with his proud people shocked but angered, hollande will want to bring physical meaning to his statement that these attacks were acts of war. and with the european union increasingly doubted over economic and sovereignty concerns (see russia’s invasion of ukraine), hollande will see this moment as a test of the eu’s resiliency. both these considerations lead me to believe that france will significantly escalate its air campaign against isis and commence special-forces ground operations against isis leaders and infrastructure.and in this response, france deserves three forms of american support. first, president obama, who was absent from the charlie hebdo memorial, should visit paris in solidarity. if possible, he should address the french parliament and offer france u.s. support in the form of escalated military retaliation. second, he should respond to this attack by energizing a more aggressive and comprehensive campaign against isis. third, president obama must draw greater attention to allied successes against isis. this should include greater publicity (including gun-camera videos) of actions like last week’s air strike on jihadi john. isis leaders and fighters must come to perceive their banner as a magnet for purposeless death, not ordained glory.we must also challenge isis in other unconventional fields, such as satire. after all, while islamic extremists hate being teased, muslims attempting to reform political islam deserve our confidence in free speech. crucially, we must debate those in our own societies who push the warped delusion that misplaced political correctness can undercut salafi jihadism.but as a first step, we must accept the consequence of what occurred on friday evening in the city of light. one hundred twenty-nine civilians went out that evening in pursuit of happiness

in september, former president barack obama took a praiseworthy stand for free speech.in the interview released by the bbc on wednesday, harry asked obama whether it is better for government to ""educate or regulate"" when it comes to internet speech. obama had a good response.""i'm big on education, as i said earlier, just because the notion that we're going to be able to corral – that we're going to be able to contain – what's said and what's not on the internet seems unachievable. and contrary to the values of an open society that both the united states and great britain and most of the advanced world adheres to. i don't want to live in a world in which the state is making decisions as to who says what.""obama is absolutely correct.moreover, his words represent a subtle but much-needed rebuke to the growing chorus of western voices who want more regulation of speech. these individuals are rendered by the usual suspects: judith butler, the lgbtq-gestapo, the art critic taliban, the ""speech is violence"" crew, but also by otherwise democratic governments.the british government, for example, wants twitter to ban speakers who do not intend to but might upset certain audiences. indeed, germany is already taking aggressive legal action to enforce social media compliance with authoritarian speech laws. and here at home on campuses and in political debates, it's clear the liberal intelligentsia wants to redefine the broad speech protections afforded under the first amendment.unfortunately, it's not simply the left that bears culpability here. as he has frequently tweeted out, president trump wants to limit free speech protections for the media.such arguments must not meet our silence. ultimately, if we value freedom, the right to live in a society in which individuals are free to air their grievances and participate in public debates, we must give preference to the right to use one's mouth over the right to shield one's ears.that divergence makes america exceptional, but as <NUM> approaches, it is under increasing threat.if barack obama wants to take a stand for freedom, good for him.",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE>

blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!feeling tired? even if we aren’t tired, why do we yawn if someone else does? experts at the university of nottingham have published research that suggests the human propensity for contagious yawning is triggered automatically by primitive reflexes in the primary motor cortex — an area of the brain responsible for motor function.their study — ‘a neural basis for contagious yawning’ — has been published in the academic journal current biology. it is another stage in their research into the underlying biology of neuropsychiatric disorders and their search for new methods of treatment.their latest findings show that our ability to resist yawning when someone else near us yawns is limited. and our urge to yawn is increased if we are instructed to resist yawning. but, no matter how hard we try to stifle a yawn, it might change how we yawn but it won’t alter our propensity to yawn. importantly, they have discovered that the urge to yawn — our propensity for contagious yawning — is individual to each one of us. stephen jackson, professor of cognitive neuroscience, in the school of psychology, led the multidisciplinary study. he said: “we suggest that these findings may be particularly important in understanding further the association between motor excitability and the occurrence of echophenomena in a wide range of clinical conditions that have been linked to increased cortical excitability and/or decreased physiological inhibition such as epilepsy, dementia, autism, and tourette syndrome.” echophenomena isn’t just a human trait contagious yawning is triggered involuntarily when we observe another person yawn — it is a common form of echophenomena — the automatic imitation of another’s words (echolalia) or actions (echopraxia). and it’s not just humans who have a propensity for contagious yawning — chimpanzees and dogs do it too. credit: steve evans wikimedia commonsechophenomena can also be seen in a wide range of clinical conditions linked to increased cortical excitability and/or decreased physiological inhibition such as epilespsy, dementia, autism and tourette syndrome. the neural basis for contagious yawning the neural basis for echophenomena is unknown. to test the link between motor excitability and the neural basis for contagious yawning the nottingham research team used transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms). they recruited <NUM> adults to help with their study. these volunteers viewed video clips showing someone else yawning and were instructed to either

bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!cia refuses to show evidence linking trump to russia because it would help russia!in the weeks subsequently after donald trump was elected president, cia analysts who work on russia refreshed their analysis about russian cyber meddling. they earlier had considered that russia was attempting to undermine the u.s. presidential election, but after nov. <NUM> they came to assume that russian interference was truly created to help trump win.this latest finding fertilized an currently blazing public argument between the u.s. intelligence agencies and the president-elect over russian interference in the election.“i don’t believe it,” trump stated in an interview shown sunday on fox news, discussing the idea that the russians desired to assist him. “i think it’s ridiculous.”trump and his aides deny not just the cia’s updated review about russian objectives, but the early consensus reached by all <NUM> agencies, and revealed in a rare joint public statement by director of national intelligence james clapper and dhs head jeh johnson, that russia was meddling in the election in the first place.the significance of the gulf can barely be overstated: numerous foreign policy experts and lawmakers think russia’s behavior was an assault on the nation. one ex – cia leader, hillary clinton advocate michael morell, compared russia’s invasion into u.s. politics friday to “the political equivalent of <NUM>/<NUM>.”the truth is, the cia’s latest take is not the unanimous perspective of the intelligence community. clapper, who oversees all <NUM> u.s. intelligence agencies, had sufficient confidence to exchange the cia’s review to congress in a secret briefing last week. but no similar review has leaked from any of the other <NUM> intelligence agencies.the fbi, for its portion, determines that russia’s main goal was to stow mayhem and challenge american democracy, a senior law enforcement official explained to nbc news. aiding trump provided that objective, the official stated, but russia didn’t anticipate trump to win the election.the cia’s review that the russians preferred trump was not determined by any single piece of new intelligence, officials briefed on the matter explained to nbc news. rather, it was the outcome of more stringent analysis of a growing body of circumstantial proof more comprehensive than anything the public has observed.human sources, communications intercepts and other intelligence have permitted analysts to piece together the details of some of the players, and the steps they took to harm clinton’s candidacy while boosting trump’s, officials stated.the cia also believed that while russian hackers collected information on republicans, they did not release any of it, the way they did with democratic emails leaked to wikileaks. the republican national committee rejects its systems were hacked, but the emails of individual republicans were collected-something nbc news documented in october.the fbi is convinced the russians did not find anything volatile in the republican material they acquired, the official stated, despite the fact that it’s not apparent whether any u.s. agency understands the full extent of what data russian hackers were capable to steal.the cia also tracked a campaign of anti-clinton news reports amplified by social media, some of which came from russian state media outlets, officials shared with nbc news.the case that the russian campaign was clearly supposed to elect trump is not something the u.s. could demonstrate in court, officials point out, which in part clarifies why fbi briefers have been more hesitant to embrace that situation in secret briefings to congress than have intelligence officials. other intelligence agencies have not supported the cia perspective, but no entity is acknowledged to oppose it.nevertheless, the question of motive-why the russians purportedly meddled in the election – is completely independent from the more basic question of whether the u.s. has strong proof that the russian government sponsored the concealed campaign.on that score, every intelligence agency in the government confirms: the russians did it.in october, dni clapper and homeland security secretary jeh johnson released an extraordinary joint statement that “the u.s. intelligence community is confident that the russian government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from us persons and institutions, including from us political organizations.”one source acquainted with the intelligence stated it incorporated profiles of some of the suspects with photographs, and could lead to inevitable indictments of specific russian actors, if the justice department chooses to go after them.the proof on that score basically doesn’t help trump’s recent commentary that “it could be russia. and it could be china. and it could be some guy in his home in new jersey.”that is why the two trump proponents who lead the congressional intelligence committees, sen. richard burr of north carolina and rep. devin nunes of california, have each supplied statements in recent days conveying worry about russian hacking.“the senate select committee on intelligence has been, and remains, concerned about russia’s actions,” burr stated in report to nbc news friday.nunes stated friday: “russia’s cyber attacks are no surprise to the house intelligence committee, which has been closely monitoring russia’s belligerence for years.”on monday, the top republicans in congress – majority leader mitch mcconnell and speaker paul ryan – each released statements pledging to investigate russian meddling in the election.ryan called russia “an aggressor,” and mcconnell made a point of saying he has “the highest confidence in the intelligence community, and especially the central intelligence agency.”on monday, sen. john mccain of arizona renewed his call for a bipartisan hearing, but stated he didn’t think russians were attempting to engineer a trump victory: “that’s the reason we need a full investigation, but i have seen no evidence of that.”it’s actual uncertain whether trump has been briefed on the same facts top republicans have observed, because he has had only a handful of intelligence briefings since the election.trump not only stated he didn’t believe the intelligence community’s review – he recommended that the cia was not to be believed in general, providing a statement friday night observing that “these are the same people that said saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction.”several intelligence officials explained to nbc news they were seriously annoyed by that statement. there is no historical precedent for a president-elect publicly maligning the intelligence agencies he is about to lead.one big dilemma currently is how trump’s pick as cia director, mike pompeo, will bridge the acrimonious gap between his boss and the agency he leads.president barack obama doesn’t plan to make it effortless on trump: he has requested that a dossier be assembled on the data about the russian covert operation.a senior obama administration official shared with nbc news that parts of that will be made public prior to january <NUM>th.sen. angus king, a maine independent who serves on the senate intelligence committee, stated to nbc news that can not occur soon enough. the way to circumvent russian information campaigns is to publicize them, he stated.he cautioned, however, is that the u.s. is not going to be able offer the sort of evidence many skeptics are requiring.“if you provide proof, you provide a roadmap to show the russians how we caught them,” he stated, “including intelligence sources and methods.”read also new york times confesses

alabama, a public university in tuscaloosa, ala., has a yellow speech rating according to the foundation for individual rights in education’s campus free speech rating system.institutions which hold a ‘yellow light speech code rating’ are defined as ones that have “at least one ambiguous policy that too easily encourages administrative abuse and arbitrary application.”the university of alabama has three policies that egregiously violate students’ first amendment rights. those policies deal with university space, event advertisement, and event planning.students can only use university space if an event is “in accordance with the priorities of the designated area.” alabama also restricts where students can pass out advertisements for an approved event and the administration requires all advertisements to be in “good taste.” the administration makes final rulings on what qualifies as good taste.“things like ground use restrictions really damage the ability of students to share ideas freely and openly,” zach warren, president of the university of alabama’s young americans for liberty chapter, told red alert politics. “on our campus any hand outs must be approved so when we hand out pocket constitutions those technically have to be submitted weeks in advance for approval.”these policies allow for administrative overreach and enable the administration to ignore students’ rights to free expression on campus.another example of a yellow light policy is alabama’s event planning policy, which requires students to submit an “online event planning form” seven to ten business days before an event. an event that requires such steps include <NUM>ks, parades, and demonstrations or marches.in the university’s opinion, these policies are designed to avoid scheduling conflicts and to allocate resources effectively.taylor bryant, university of alabama’s director of communications, told red alert politics in an email that these policies supposedly help “ensure the safety of our students and campus community and offers all campus-affiliated parties the same opportunities without disrupting the university’s ability to provide its essential services of teaching and learning.”“our grounds use permit policy allows campus affiliates to request the space that meets their needs and helps university staff coordinate appropriate campus resources (security, grounds keeping, etc.) and avoid scheduling conflicts,” bryant stated.these policies have been abused by ua in the past as seen in october <NUM> when ua imposed a $<NUM>,<NUM> security fee on the ua college republicans chapter for bringing milo yiannopoulos to campus. after initially expecting a fee of $<NUM>,<NUM>, ua continually increased the amount of the required security fee as the event drew near. only after experiencing significant pushback from students did the university rescind the fee and allow the event to go on as planned.“while policies like those at university alabama are not unique, what makes them especially egregious are the layers upon layers of red tape that the university puts on students to exercise their first amendment rights,” said alexander staudt, director of free speech at young americans for liberty. “whether it is restricting space-use based on the priorities of that area or requiring a ‘good taste’ stamp of approval from administration for advertisements,

committee on benghazi skewered an <NUM>-page report made public tuesday by panel republicans for presenting no new facts about the sept. <NUM>, <NUM> terror attack.aside from questioning <NUM> witnesses that had never before been interviewed by congressional investigators, the select committee reviewed thousands of previously undisclosed documents and drew new conclusions about the administration's handling of the terror attack.below are nine things the benghazi committee uncovered in its <NUM>-month investigation.email serverhillary clinton's use of a private email account and server was unknown to previous congressional committees that looked into the circumstances surrounding benghazi.dozens of emails discussing the attack and libya were hidden on that server, including some that shed light on how clinton and her aides initially sought to take ""ownership"" of the libyan invasion.when news of clinton's private email use first broke in march <NUM>, the benghazi committee seemingly entered a new, highly-politicized phase. her server scandal took off just as she was preparing to enter the presidential race, injecting partisan vitriol into an investigation that had proceeded in relative quiet up to that point.the examination of clinton's private emails led the committee to a previously unknown force that had helped shape the secretary of state's policy in the run-up to benghazi: sidney blumenthal.blumenthal behind the scenesa divisive political operative who was barred from working in the obama administration, sidney blumenthal provided unvetted intelligence to clinton about libya even as he attempted to cultivate business opportunities in the war-torn country.blumenthal appeared before the committee in june <NUM>, where his commercial dealings and potential conflicts of interest were questioned in a closed-door interview.at issue was the fact that a partisan figure had a direct line to the secretary of state on matters as sensitive as the regime change in libya. in fact, many of blumenthal's missives to clinton have since been marked classified by the state department.the extent of blumenthal's influence was not uncovered in previous investigations of benghazi.hillary's upcoming visitthe select committee revealed clinton herself was set to visit libya weeks after the sept. <NUM>, <NUM> attack, a plan that was scrapped after the benghazi raid.that scheduled trip was one of many instances that highlighted the state department's severe misreading of the security situation in libya.clinton's planned visit had implications for ambassador chris stevens, who was laying the groundwork for her travel when he was killed in the attackgregory hicks, deputy chief of mission in libya, told committee investigators the ambassador's stay in benghazi was ""absolutely"" related to clinton's visit.permanent poststevens had journeyed to benghazi to work on a ""deliverable"" for clinton's upcoming trip, the select committee revealed.his work on that deliverable involved preparing a proposal to turn the temporary diplomatic compound in benghazi into a permanent post.""[w]e had begun the process of developing a political rationale for having a permanent post in benghazi,"" hicks testified.the report said state department discussions of benghazi's deteriorating security situation earlier in <NUM> framed outbreaks of violence as ""anomalies"" as officials forged ahead with a plan to establish a diplomatic presence in the coastal libyan city.given his now-famous affection for the people of libya, stevens was an advocate of the plan.gadhafi rescuersthe select committee discovered a group that ""most u.s. government personnel did not even know existed"" helped the americans trapped at the cia annex escape on the morning of sept. <NUM>.""this group, ironically, had close ties to the former gadhafi regime — the very regime the united states had helped remove from power,"" the report said.the report credited that group, which was affiliated with deposed dictator muammar gadhafi, with sparing ""dozens of lives.""according to the select committee's findings, a cia agent who had never previously been interviewed by other congressional investigators facilitated the evacuation with the gadhafi militia's help. the cia was ""reluctant"" to allow the committee to interview that agent.the ""libyan military intelligence,"" as the group was known, arrived with a motorcade of <NUM> vehicles to transport the state department and cia personnel under siege at the annex to the airport, where they could be evacuated to tripoli.some of those vehicles were fitted with machine guns and others had secure fixtures that would allow the fleet to escape with the americans while taking fire.the cia agent in question had contacted the libyan military intelligence for help after receiving a referral from a ""helpless"" contingent of local police officers who had been tapped to secure the annex but proved unable to do so.the committee focused on the fact that, for all of the state department's focus on cultivating relationships with the burgeoning libyan government, the only people who tried to help the americans were those cast aside by the agency.""[s]ome of the very individuals the united states had helped remove from power during the libyan revolution were the only libyans that came to the assistance of the united states on the night of the benghazi attacks,"" the report said.uniform problemsmarines in rota, spain who were awaiting orders to head for benghazi experienced hours of delay due to concern about what they were wearing, one witness told the select committee.after c-<NUM> planes reached the base and the marines, who were part of a fleet antiterrorism security team known as a fast force, prepared to take off for tripoli, a three-hour delay ensued due to deliberations about whether the company members should wear their military uniforms or civilian clothes, and whether they would be permitted to carry weapons.""[w]e were told multiple times to change what we were wearing,"" the platoon commander testified. ""there was also some talk of whether or not we could carry our personal weapons.""the commander testified that he advocated for his team to be allowed to carry weapons because they were headed into ""a very violent thing going on the ground.""in all, the marines were forced to change their clothes four times before they were deployed to libya, according to testimony.gen. carter ham, the-commander of africom, told the committee he did not learn of the uniform changes ""until after the fact"" and even then could not pinpoint a reason for the three-hour delay in rota.that delay had come after the c-<NUM>s took six hours to arrive from germany despite receiving orders to fly there at once.""the fact that nearly twenty-four hours elapsed until those [fast] forces actually arrived in tripoli to reinforce the security there belies the expectations of the american people that the u.s. military can and will move expeditiously,"" the committee report said.discussions over whether to force the fast marines to wear civilian clothes took place in washington, where high-level officials expressed concerns about a military show of force in libya.""[t]hey wanted to minimize the signature that looked like a big military invasion, a big military arrival there,"" one witness testified.rather than increase the safety of the marines en route to benghazi, ""the benefit of having the fast platoon wear civilian clothing was to cater to unexpressed libyan government concerns about military appearances,"" the report said.according to the report, patrick kennedy, the state department's undersecretary for management, suggested the fast platoon shed their uniforms during a key white house meeting the night of the attack.white house meetingaround <NUM>:<NUM> p.m. washington time on the night of the raid, high-level officials gathered via secure video teleconference to discuss the events unfolding in benghazi. neither president obama nor defense secretary leon panetta was present.clinton attended, as well as several of her top aides and kennedy.the meeting was not convened until four hours after the attack began. sean smith and stevens had already died.""despite the secretary [of defense]'s expectation the assets he ordered to deploy would move as fast as possible in order to respond, the individuals who participated in the white house meeting, nevertheless, felt the need to 'work through' the assets the secretary had already ordered to deploy,"" the report said.republicans on the committee noted that meeting participants became

nicetiesadministration officials placed tremendous importance on the way their actions would be perceived in libya during the attack, the report found.for example, military assets in europe were not allowed to take off for benghazi until the administration received clearance from the libyan government to enter libyan airspace.but the process was lengthy and required a libyan government official to receive paperwork for the request in person when no such official was on duty overnight as the attacks were unfolding.before the raid even began, diplomatic concerns prevented the state department from greenlighting a higher security profile for the ambassador in benghazi even though the conditions in the country warranted one.'no connection' to cairofor weeks after the benghazi attack, the administration attempted to link the violence in libya to a relatively peaceful protest in cairo hours earlier that had erupted over an inflammatory youtube clip.internal correspondence obtained by the committee suggests that, rather than receiving conflicting intelligence on the matter, the administration knew within hours that the attack in benghazi had little to do with the demonstrations in cairo.""for [press] guidance, if pressed whether we see a connection between these two. we have no information regarding a connection between these incidents."" nuland wrote of the events in benghazi

cap value report (tue <NUM> jan <NUM>) – quindell, elco, lpa, boku, eye, flo, ssy% of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents.headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!hi, it’s paul here.please feel free to post your comments, and small cap requests in the comments below.quindell postscriptthis announcement caught my eye. the audit firm which signed off quindell’s dodgy accounts for <NUM>/<NUM> has been fined £<NUM>k + £<NUM>k costs by the financial reporting council (frc). this obscure body supposedly polices published accounts. however it rarely seems to take action, and when it does, is very slow.the audit partner responsible, has also been reprimanded (big deal!) and fined £<NUM>k – which is not a material sum of money to a partner in a decent-sized accountancy firm. also, look at the timeline – it’s now <NUM> years from those incorrect accounts being created. hardly a rapid response team!as longer term readers here will remember, i was consistently very bearish on quindell, since its accounts were fairly obviously highly suspect. excessive debtors, excessive capitalisation into intangible assets, and a flurry of acquisitions to muddy the waters, are the usual give-aways of fake profits, so these dodgy companies are really terribly easy to spot. you can spot a highly abnormal balance sheet in just a few seconds, so it really doesn’t take any particular forensic accounting skills to uncover dodgy companies with false profits. you just have to have your wits about you.the same was true with globo. it was amazing how much venom from deluded fools in the investing community my bearish comments attracted over these <NUM> dodgy companies. there was even an attempt to get me sacked from this role at stockopedia, by quindell/globo shareholders cancelling their stockopedia subscriptions! of course, ed put editorial integrity before short term revenues, backing me to the hilt. that i was proven correct by subsequent events, was very satisfying.anyway, the perpetrators of the quindell and globo frauds are still at large, with their ill-gotten gains, having relieved gullible uk investors of hundreds of millions of pounds. as i sadly commented to an investor friend at the weekend, white collar crime in the uk very much does pay. the action taken by the frc, reported today, is too little, too late, in my view, to properly punish, or deter, the same sort of thing happening again.kudos by the way, to tom winnifrith, for his tireless, obsessive exposure of multiple wrongdoings at both quindell and globo. people may not like his style, but he’s done outstanding work exposing many dodgy companies.having worked in audit myself, at the start of my career in the early <NUM>s, i can confirm that it’s really very easy to pull the wool over the eyes of auditors. their checks on the numbers are not very detailed, and a clever fd can cover up all sorts of problems. so the onus is very much on investors to do our own reasonableness-checking on published accounts. if the numbers don’t look right, then it’s best to steer clear.a popular misconception is that auditors are highly paid. they’re actually not. audits are often tendered at low prices, in order to get a foot in the door, to enable more lucrative tax, and acquisition-related work to be secured.there seems to be an invisible force pulling the american markets relentlessly higher, with no significant pullback in a long time. this is very worrying. some are describing it as a “melt up”. this is not normal, or healthy market behaviour, in my view. could we be heading for a crash? i don’t know. markets are meant to “climb a wall of worry”, with regular corrections. this seemingly unstoppable move upwards could be the precursor to a violent correction, possibly?successful trader mark minervini recently tweeted that the only times he can remember the american market being this exuberant, were just before the <NUM> crash, and just before the dot.com bubble bursting in <NUM>.however, this big rise could be justified? maybe us shares are re-rating because the big corporate tax cuts in the us will increase earnings considerably? that in turn could trigger an economic boom, of increased investment amp; a virtuous circle of higher growth, greater consumer spending, etc. who knows? that’s what happened under president reagan, after all – he initially stimulated the us economy with big tax cuts, which ushered in a period of great economic success.these things are impossible to predict, and nearly all forecasters get it so wrong that you would have expected them to pack in forecasting as a bad job. yet strangely, people (especially the media) still treat their forecasts with quite unjustified reverence. economics is still very much in its infancy, and has barely scratched the surface, in terms of being able to accurately predict what the economy will do in practice.so i think it’s best to accept that we haven’t got a clue what the future holds. despite this, i’m increasingly nervous about this market melt-up, so have opened some short positions on the us markets. that’s proving expensive so far, but i don’t mind losses on hedges. they’re an insurance policy, and insurance costs money.as regards the uk markets, i’m seeing a lot of nervousness in small to mid caps at the moment. it feels like the days of everything going up, day after day, are now over. we’ve been spoiled by very buoyant market conditions, for a long time now.there are many former momentum stars, which have sold off considerably in the last few months (e.g. boohoo.com (lon:boo) (i’m long) and iqe (lon:iqe) . investors seem to be ignoring many satisfactory, or even good updates, and banking profits instead. there certainly seems a lack of investor appetite to take small caps to new highs at the moment. that’s probably quite sensible actually, as lots of small caps are now very pricey, and the uk economy seems to be in a soft patch, so there seem to be lots of profit warnings being issued.mind you, bargains can be found in illiquid markets, when some investors start throwing out the baby with the bath water, and/or see their stop losses triggered for no particular underlying reason. i favour such market conditions, as from time to time the market throws a bargain in my direction, as people sometimes act irrationally – scared out of good shares by erratic spikes down in price.anyway, let’s have a look at some small cap announcements today. by the way, i apologise for any typos today – am using a small laptop, with a screen that i’m struggling to see properly.(lon:elco)share price: <NUM>.<NUM>p (up <NUM>.<NUM>% today)no. shares: <NUM>.<NUM>mmarket cap: £<NUM>.<NUM>m(at the time of writing, i hold a long position in this share)trading statementelecosoft plc (aim: elco), the aim-listed construction software specialist…clever wording makes it sounds better than it is! this is an in line update;… is pleased to announce that revenue and profit before tax trading for the year ended <NUM> december <NUM> are both expected to be significantly higher compared with revenue and profit before tax for the year ended <NUM> december <NUM> and in line with market expectations.cash generation sounds good;elecosoft’s strong conversion of operating profits into cash in the year enabled the group to eliminate its net borrowing position at <NUM> june <NUM> and to also improve its net cash position further as at <NUM> december <NUM>.i love it when companies eliminate their debt through cash generation.other points;high customer renewal rates (a good sign – the product must be good)emphasis on good training amp; support for customers (again, a good thing)successful acquisition has been integrated.favourable forex movements.outlook – nothing specific, just says “look forward with confidence”my opinion – i picked up a few of these shares a while back, on a positive update. generally i’m not keen on software companies, as they’re quite prone to profit warnings – often being heavily reliant on lumpy licence sales.this share looks priced about right, in my view. it’s good to have a reassuring update today under its belt.stockopedia remains to be convinced, with a “neutral” style, and a middling stockrank of <NUM>. let’s hope those improve, if financial performance continues to be good.(lon:lpa)share price: <NUM>,<NUM>p (up <NUM>.<NUM>% today, at <NUM>:<NUM>)no. shares: <NUM>.<NUM>mmarket cap: £<NUM>.<NUM>m(at the time of writing, i have a long position in this share)final results – for the year ended <NUM> sep <NUM>lpa group plc (lpa) is a designer, manufacturer and supplier of light emitting diode (led)-based lighting and electro-mechanical systems.it announces today;…record results for the year ended <NUM> september <NUM> and a strong start to the new financial year.this company put out a positive-sounding trading update, which i covered here on <NUM> nov <NUM>. as often happens, the surge in share price on the day (responding to a positive update amp; outlook) continued, with the share price rising about another <NUM>% today.i won’t spend long on this company, as it’s too small amp; illiquid – i was only able to pick up a few shares. it might be of interest to readers with small portfolios, who don’t have a problem with illiquid positions.key points;revenues up <NUM>% to £<NUM>.<NUM>mpre-exceptional operating profit up <NUM>% to £<NUM>.<NUM>m (exceptionals are negligible, so nothing to worry about there)basic eps up <NUM>.<NUM>% to <NUM>.<NUM>p – giving a per of <NUM>.<NUM>dividends are modest, but growing – up from <NUM>.<NUM>p last year, to <NUM>.<NUM>p this year – a yield of <NUM>.<NUM>%order intake amp; closing order book both up nicely, so the outlook amp; visibility are positive.recent trading – q<NUM> “significantly ahead” of prior year.balance sheet – looks fine to me, with a sound working capital position. there’s a little debt, but i don’t see that as a problem. note there is a pension fund, which is in surplus on an accounting level, but may be in deficit on an actuarial basis. it’s not significant, as the cashflow statement shows £<NUM>k p.a. payments by the company into the fund.capex looks high, but the narrative mentions relocating its factory, which is likely to have caused a spike in capex.my opinion – based on a quick review only, i quite like the figures amp; outlook here. so for micro cap investors, happy to accept poor market liquidity, this might be worth a closer look. it seems soundly financed, performing well, and has a strong order book. plus it pays modest divis. i think it would be worthwhile to do some more digging, to understand what products it makes.the crucial consideration is whether demand is likely to continue, or whether the company is riding on the crest of a wave from one-off orders? overall though, it’s worth a closer look i think.note that the stockopedia data (from thomson reuters) shows only <NUM>.<NUM>p eps expectation for <NUM>. so the actual of eps of <NUM>.<NUM>p is a long way ahead of that. therefore, we can probably anticipate an improving stockrank, once the actual numbers flow through. so i’ll wager that this middling stockrank could start to improve soon;(lon:boku)share price: <NUM>p (unchanged today)no. shares: <NUM>.<NUM>mmarket cap: £<NUM>.<NUM>mtrading updateboku (aim: boku), the world’s leading independent direct carrier billing company, is pleased to provide the following unaudited trading update for the year ended <NUM> december <NUM>. this is the company’s first trading update since admission to aim in november <NUM>.my understanding is that this company’s software enables people to buy things on their mobile phones (apps, games, etc) without the need for a credit card. the cost is instead routed to their mobile phone bill, or prepaid account. this is useful in countries where credit cards are not widely used.<NUM> revenues exceed $<NUM>m – up <NUM>% on <NUM> – and an adjusted ebitda positive second halfas we know, adjusted ebitda can hide a multitude of sins – especially at software companies, where large amounts of overheads can be capitalised, thus flattering ebitda.this is impressive;total processed value (tpv)** of $<NUM>.<NUM>bn for <NUM> was more than triple the <NUM> amount of $<NUM> million thanks to continued growth across all customer segments – most notably app stores and digital music subscriptions amp; bundlingalthough if a tripling of total processed value only results in a <NUM>% rise in revenues, doesn’t that suggest individual transactions are being done a lot more cheaply?looking on the stockreport, my first port of call for any new company is the historical graphs. these have already scared me off;my opinion – it’s clearly a jam tomorrow situation. the £<NUM>.<NUM>m market cap clearly includes some heroic assumptions about future growth. i don’t tend to buy into things like that, unless i really understand the sector amp; the business, which is not the case here. so i think this one is really just for punters, and people who properly understand the business, and think it’s likely to deliver the massive growth necessary for the current market cap (let alone a higher one).this reminds me of bango (lon:bgo) which looks similar, and is also relying on exponential growth to justify its extremely high (relative to historic losses) valuation.so these <NUM> shares could be multibaggers, if the growth gains momentum, or they could crash disastrously, if growth disappoints, and heavy losses continue – requiring further fundraises in future. high risk, potentially high reward. they’re not for me – why take the risk?(lon:eye)share price: <NUM>p (down <NUM>.<NUM>% today, at <NUM>:<NUM>)no. shares: <NUM>.<NUM>mmarket cap: £<NUM>.<NUM>mtrading updateeagle eye, the saas technology company that allows businesses to create a real-time connection with their customershere’s our archive of my <NUM> previous reports on this company. you can find this list of articles on any company, just by putting in the ticker, then clicking on the “discuss” tab, at the top of the stockreport.i don’t like the company’s new description of what it does, as it doesn’t actually explain what the company does! its previous description from a july <NUM> announcement was much more clear;saas technology company that validates and redeems digital promotions in real-time for the grocery, retail and hospitality industrieswhy change something clear, to something opaque? a very odd thing to do. clarity, and simplicity are always best.it reports today on progress for h<NUM> of <NUM>/<NUM>, being the <NUM> months to <NUM> dec <NUM>. so it has a <NUM> june <NUM> year end.here are the highlights, as presented by the company, and yellow highlighting from me;there is strong growth in various kpis there, but revenue is only up <NUM>% – not madly exciting. i tend to prefer revenue growth of <NUM>%+ at growth companies – because you don’t need to grow at that rate compounded, for long before the figures get exciting.cash – the other thing that jumps out at me from this list, is that the company seems to have burned through most of its cash. looking back through previous rnss, the company raised £<NUM>m (before expenses) or £<NUM>.<NUM>m after expenses, in jun <NUM>. so i’m rather surprised it’s only got £<NUM>.<NUM>m left. maybe there was some debt that was repaid as part of the previous fundraise? ah yes, i’ve spotted a £<NUM>m facility with barclays in the last full year accounts, which looks as if it’s currently undrawn. i’m not keen on loss-making companies using bank borrowings.clearly the company will need to do another placing fairly soon, as it’s still cash hungry. a lot of development costs are being capitalised. this is not necessarily a problem, as the company seems well-supported by investors, with a generous market cap for a loss-making company. so raising, say, another £<NUM>m would only result in c.<NUM>% dilution – unhelpful, but not a disaster.outlook – there’s lots of commentary in today’s update about customer wins, etc.the conclusion is;… confidence of delivering its expectations for the financial year ending <NUM> june <NUM>.my opinion – there’s definitely something interesting here, in my view. this company clearly has an interesting, innovative product, with big name customers.however, for me the financial progress has to date been somewhat limited. it’s still quite heavily loss-making.looking at the broker forecasts, there are big expectations for revenue growth, rising to £<NUM>.<NUM>m in <NUM>/<NUM>, and £<NUM>.<NUM>m in <NUM>/<NUM>. yet these big increases in revenues would only just tip it into normalised profit before tax of just £<NUM>.<NUM>m in <NUM>/<NUM>. i’m struggling to see how that justifies a £<NUM>.<NUM>m market cap now.this share would therefore only interest me, if i could be convinced that the company is set to smash those forecasts, and deliver much higher growth and future profitability. as things stand though, i think it looks an interesting company, with a promising-sounding product, but the financials don’t look very good yet, and the price looks a bit toppy. plus it will need to raise more equity fairly soon, so i’d rather hold fire and re-assess it once it’s properly funded. i’d say a placing of £<NUM>m+ is really necessary, rather than doing repeat, smaller fundraisings. the danger of that, is that the fundraising window can easily slam shut, in a future bear market, leaving the company potentially high amp; dry.the stockopedia computers only award eye a low stockrank of <NUM> – which is understandable, as early stage, loss-making companies nearly always fail to excite either the stockopedia algorithms, or me!anyway, i wish the company well, and look forward to reviewing it again when the next set of numbers come out. as usual, i reserve the right to change my mind at any time, if growth accelerates and makes it a more exciting investment proposition.(lon:flo)share price: <NUM>.<NUM>p (down <NUM>.<NUM>% today)no. shares: <NUM>.<NUM>mmarket cap: £<NUM>.<NUM>mtrading updatelondon: tuesday <NUM> january <NUM>: aim listed specialist technical fluid power products supplierflowtech fluidpower plc (lse: symbol flo), is pleased to announce the following unaudited update on its performance for the year ended <NUM> december <NUM> and to the period up to this announcement…the update starts with an in line with expectations comment, and positive noises about further expansion;“pbt in line with expectations, whilst the group’s heightened profile and enhanced technical skills capabilities created in both the uk and europe has ensured that opportunities for further significant expansion have continued to be presented”revenues up <NUM>% to £<NUM>.<NUM>m. scanning through the rns, the group seems to have made several acquisitions in <NUM>, which has obviously pushed up revenues. organic growth is good, at +<NUM>%.net debt has risen <NUM>% to £<NUM>.<NUM>m. note that there has also been some dilution this year, from an equity fundraising.this is an excellent update, with lots of useful information;divisional gross margins remain broadly in line with the prior year. as a result of a weightier mix towards the generally lower margin pmc operations, a slight reduction in overall margin % is projected, therefore, the board expects underlying* profit before tax for the year ended <NUM> december <NUM> will be in the range <NUM>.<NUM>m to <NUM>.<NUM>m, which is in line with market expectations.i’m impressed that the group can give a fairly tight range of likely profit, <NUM> days after the year end. this suggests to me that it has a competent finance department, with good internal controls.six acquisitions were made during the year, which strikes me as perhaps being a bit too ambitious. there’s a risk that this might have stretched management bandwidth a little thin?a refurbished/redesigned shared logistics centre has also been completed, with no disruption to customer service. this management team really have been busy! impressive stuff.dividends will rise <NUM>%, giving a yield of <NUM>.<NUM>% – not bad.valuation – this looks reasonably priced, on the cheap side, even when you adjust for net debt;the stockrank is very high, and it is also classified as a “super stock”;my opinion – i like it. this is a stock we’ve looked at here before, and felt positive about. it strikes me as a good quality buy amp; build, which appears to be managed very well.i like the decent operating profit margin – which comes from holding a wide range of niche spare parts for various machinery, and high levels of customer service, e.g. rapid delivery options, which is vital when the clients’ important machines are idle, waiting on a spare part from flo.this share looks to me as if it could continue to be a steady riser, as more acquisitions are bolted on. so a thumbs up from me. here’s the flo chart (geddit?!!!) – if we’d bought that dip in july <NUM>, we’d be <NUM>% up, plus divis, by now. that’s something to think about.(work in progress.)stockopediasource:

may receive one of these when you engage with someone’s account by following them or liking a tweet of theirs. immediately after you click “follow”, a program automatically sends you a pre-written message. i’m not entirely against the idea of auto dm services, but it’s gotten completely out of hand and is mostly used irresponsibly. the end result is an inbox saturated with pointless messages, forcing your authentic one-on-one interactions to the bottom. here are the worst seven messages i’ve received:hola. gracias por seguirme. me dejas saber si hay algo en que lo puedo ayudar a innovar! if you’re going to send anyone a message, make sure it’s in the person’s native speaking language. even when translated, the message is the standard “thanks, let me know if i can help.” i’m not sure how many people are asking for help from strangers on twitter sending a pm. [suspicious looking domain] that was it. just a typo domain in the message screaming “click through at your own risk.” thnx <NUM> following me. be the ceo of you! #supply another generic message. i’m not sure what action you want me to take with a statement like this. the hashtag is unrelated to their previous statement and they didn’t take the time to even spell out “thank you.” one thing is for sure, i am the ceo of me, and i’m in supply. i appreciate you as one of my recent follower. please rt if you like my thoughts. linkedin: [removed] and like my facebook page – there are more than a few things wrong with this dm. this person’s first mistake is starting with a version of “thank you.” you’re only adding insult to injury by thanking someone through an automatic message. it’s a waste of space and we end up with <NUM> of them in our inbox just saying “thanks.”– at least we’re heading in some semblance of the correct direction with this one. they’re giving us a legitimate action to take and asking to retweet them. your fans will retweet you if they want to, not because you asked using poor grammar.– it doesn’t make sense to randomly insert their linkedin profile and the demand to like their facebook page. apparently following them on twitter just wasn’t enough. if you’re using automatic messages as a sales funnel, don’t just direct someone to another social platform unless you’ve heavily monetized it. send them to sign up for your newsletter or give them a discount and push them to your web store instead. listen to the [removed] song on my sound cloud channel?? this one speaks for itself. while it might be advantageous for them to get more traffic to their song and channel for whatever reason, they failed to insert the entire name and author of the song, what their channel is, or even a link. if you’re going to request an action from a stranger in a dm, don’t make them do any research. hi edward zeiden! thank you for following!! what are your hobbies or interests? this message makes me think i accidentally signed up for a dating website. when you open your eyesto the magic of who you are,even in the blackness of night,…[it goes on like this for <NUM> more lines] this is definitely one of the more unique ones, but still unwarranted, long, and without a point.if you’re going to use an auto dm service, make sure your message is proofed for grammar and spelling, gives something back to the receiver as a true token of gratitude, and present a clear and concise action to take.here’s a decent example i found: get <NUM>% off your next order at [removed] with code tweet<NUM> at [website]. i’m not thrilled with receiving an ad i didn’t sign up for, but it’s a step in the right direction. if they also sent me a medium link to an educational article they wrote that aligned with my interests, that would soften the blow. remember that when you use an auto dm service, it’s usually to increase engagement on twitter, push users to your website to read your blog, take a survey, or buy something. if you’re not doing one of these, and in a quick and professional manner, it’s best to skip the message and try tweeting real content.source:

their business.fast-forward to <NUM> and the average domain buyer has changed. sure, there are still plenty of businesses buying domains to use for themselves but it’s not secret that most of the domain buying activity is coming from china. buyers in china are treating domain names like an asset, which i have always thought made a lot of sense.i think as time goes on we’ll see increased buying activity from all over the world as people start to realize that domain names offer some of the same opportunities (or better) than we’ve seen with the stock market and real estate. with this shift also comes new sources of data, new blogs, and more places to follow the ever-changing market activity.for me domaining.com continues to be a daily go-to resource and a lot of the blogs on here do a

ways to routinely back it up.social media downloadkeep in mind, that while these directions and links are taken directly from social media sites, they quite often like to change the exact steps and

gives soros groups millions to destabilize macedonia’s conservative govt.headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!the u.s. government has quietly spent millions of taxpayer dollars to destabilize the democratically elected, center-right government in macedonia by colluding with leftwing billionaire philanthropist george soros, records obtained by judicial watch show. barack obama’s u.s. ambassador to macedonia, jess l. baily, has worked behind the scenes with soros’ open society foundation to funnel large sums of american dollars for the cause, constituting an interference of the u.s. ambassador in domestic political affairs in violation of the vienna convention on diplomatic relations.the cash flows through the state department and the famously corrupt u.s. agency of international development (usaid), which is charged with providing global economic, development and humanitarian assistance. usaid has allocated about $<NUM> million to leftwing soros groups in macedonia since <NUM>, documents show, and at least $<NUM>.<NUM> million has been earmarked by the agency to intervene in the balkan nation’s governmental affairs for <DATE>. state department figures have been tougher to come by and judicial watch has filed a freedom of information act (foia) request for the numbers. judicial watch also fired off a public records request to usaid because the preliminary figures, obtained through various sources in both the u.s. and macedonia, appear to be incomplete.here’s how the clandestine operation functions, according to high-level sources in macedonia and the u.s. that have provided judicial watch with records as part of an ongoing investigation. the open society foundation has established and funded dozens of leftwing, nongovernmental organizations (ngos) in macedonia to overthrow the conservative government. one macedonian government official interviewed by judicial watch in washington d.c. recently, calls it the “soros infantry.” the groups organize youth movements, create influential media outlets and organize violent protests to undermine the institutions and policies implemented by the government. one of the soros’ groups funded the translation and publication of saul alinsky’s “rules for radicals” into macedonian. the book is a tactical manual of subversion, provides direct advice for radical street protests and proclaims lucifer to be the first radical. thanks to obama’s ambassador, who has not been replaced by president trump, uncle sam keeps the money flowing so the groups can continue operating and recruiting, sources in macedonia and the u.s. confirm.with a population of about <NUM> million, macedonia has one of the more conservative governments in europe. this includes the lowest flat tax in europe, close ties with israel and pro-life policies. the country recently built a border fence to crackdown on an illegal immigration crisis that overwhelmed law enforcement agencies. between <NUM>,<NUM> and <NUM>,<NUM> illegal aliens were crossing the greek-macedonian border daily at the peak of the european migration crisis, a macedonian official told judicial watch, and the impact was devastating. this is likely of big interest to soros, a renowned open borders advocate who pushes international governance, diminished u.s. global power and an increase in muslim immigration. soros spent tens of millions of dollars to support hillary clinton’s presidential campaign. just this month hungary’s prime minister lashed out against soros for funding groups to secretly influence the country’s politics. “large-bodied predators are swimming here in the waters,” said viktor orban in his annual state of the nation speech. “this is the trans-border empire of george soros, with tons of money and international heavy artillery.”this appears to be the case in macedonia with the help of american financing. there have been a number of violent protests in recent months that have been coordinated by soros’ open society foundation through its u.s.-funded ngos, sources tell judicial watch. some u.s. members of congress have expressed interest in the issue and have demanded answers from ambassador baily, usaid and the state department. in typical fashion, the state department has stonewalled the inquiries and usaid hasn’t been much more forthcoming. last month utah senator mike lee sent ambassador baily a letter asking questions involving the u.s. mission to macedonia’s involvement in the political process and its connections to the open society foundation. it’s unlikely that americans will receive answers, especially since baily is probably on his way out. the fact remains however, that millions of u.s. taxpayer dollars have already been spent on this illicit operation and the government agencies need to be held accountable.the post u.s. gives soros groups millions to destabilize macedonia’s conservative govt. appeared

everyone can agree on is this: if viewed as a single macro-organism, humanity has fallen ill. with the ascension of donald trump onto the highest throne of political power on planet earth, some of us might feel that the sickness is finally going to be called out, illumined and healed, while others feel that trump and his administration are themselves the current purveyors, lineage holders and embodiments of the sickness. either way, the fact that humanity is not well — afflicted with some sort of disorder — is something that i think we can all agree upon; this might be a good starting point for our inquiry.the obvious question: what is the nature of this deeper sickness that is pulsing through the veins of humanity?in contemplating this very question, philosopher john mcmurtry, author of the brilliant book the cancer stage of capitalism, refers to the “great sickness” that pervades our modern day capitalist system as having all of the hallmark qualities of cancer. using a

copblockersheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!the post below was written by joseph tye, of tx copblock, and posted at various other alternative media outlets. these are great tips for anyone but most certainly for a copblocker. tye may do additional features, that are more detailed, in the future so if you have questions, concerns or suggestions please comment below.the first thing i notice about many activists and protesters is their total lack of digital security. most of us carry around a computer in our pocket that allows us to do amazing things, from recording high definition videos and taking photos to accessing the most amazing collection of data the human race has ever amassed. yet despite the capabilities of this amazing device, few actually understand what this device is capable of. this will be a basic guide written for the average user, and as such it will gloss over many things, and drastically over-simplify the technical aspects of many others for the sake of simplicity.every time that you use a computer of any kind, certain security precautions must be taken in order to ensure your personal safety from both those who would steal your data and the state which may wish to either claim that you have violated one or more of their illegitimate rules, or else simply frame you for such. basic security measures are inexpensive, often free, and easy enough for even those less technical users.click banner above to connect with a copblock group near youthe first recommendation is always to fully encrypt your device. as the recent fbi vs. apple court case showed, even this simple step is enough to put a thorn in the side of a huge state agency with practically limitless resources. encryption is a way to make the data useless without the correct passphrase. while recent iphones (anything after the iphone <NUM>gs) are encrypted by default, android devices are not.however, this is a very simple process, and step-by-step guides for every device available are easily accessed through a simple online search. most devices running a recent version of the android operating system can be encrypted by going to settings > more (tab) > security. make sure your phone is fully charged before attempting this, as it may take a while. if given the option, always choose to fully encrypt any external memory you have in your phone.many people love the option of using a fingerprint to decrypt their phone and consider it to be highly secure, however, please take into account the courts have ruled that you have a right against self-incrimination that is enumerated under the fifth amendment against giving up your passphrase in order to decrypt your phone, while you have no right against giving up your finger print. if arrested for any activism, it is highly likely that your mobile device will be seized, and unless you wish the actors of the state to have access to everything on it, (think of photos and videos of persons committing civil disobedience, personal photos or data, access to your social media, etc.) then this is something you may wish to take into account. also, it is impossible for state agents to plant “suicide notes,” or evidence on something they cannot access. just having a passcode on your phone does not mean it cannot be accessed, it must be encrypted!========= multi-author

graphicfurther security precautions would include turning off wi-fi and bluetooth when you are not actively using them. these features provide others with a way to access your phone that you do not want.the second recommendation is for a good antivirus program. you may call this a cell phone, but it is not. it is a mobile computer with phone capabilities. if you cannot afford a paid program, then there are some that are available for free, of which i recommend bitdefender. however, i personally only use kaspersky internet security for my android. i have found it to be among the best available with a feature set that is particularly useful for those involved in activism, including the ability to remotely lock the phone, and even remotely wipe the phone of data. here i must make a legal disclaimer, in all jurisdictions i am aware of, it is illegal to tamper with evidence, and wiping data from a phone could be taken as such if the state agents wish to make a case against you, so use such features at your own discretion. personally, i like having this option available. remember that not all people who would seek to exploit your information are employees of the state.for those who wish to use the internet anonymously from their mobile device and prevent others from being able to electronically gather their passphrases used over the internet when browsing over an unsecure wi-fi hotspot then a virtual private network(vpn) is a must have. paid vpn services are cheap, fast, and easy to use. arguably the best available is “private internet access.” it can be bought anonymously over the internet and downloaded to a total of five devices. this service provides a secure connection from your device, be it a mobile device or home personal computer to one of over thirty of their servers world-wide. your data cannot be read until it reaches their end server and is decrypted there. this not only prevents people from being able to intercept your data over wi-fi but can also be used to mask your true location. the encryption protocols offered by the company private internet access are the best available, and considered as of yet to be unbreakable. the free options available are much more difficult for a beginner, and tend to have far more restricted bandwidth (they are “slow”).attn: phone security <NUM> for copblockers is a post from cop block – badges

trump! blockchain stocks are next!a redneck’s guide to reversing their control of your brainno matter how historically incorrect, so many people (jews and non-jews) cannot help but use their brainwashed minds to play the hitler card. case in point is stephen lendman’s recent post about israeli viciousness:israel treats palestinians the way hitler persecuted jews. every day is kristallnacht for long-suffering people under apartheid conditions worse than south africa’s.this is not to say that he is incorrect about israeli viciousness (because they are apparently vicious, murdering monsters). this is not to argue his defense of palestinians (because i agree). but for smart people (much like sweetie zuesse) to continually use the standard erroneous brainwashing to bolster a point, in direct opposition to historical fact, makes them opportunists at best and liars at worst. i don’t think there is another subject so erroneously engrained within the psyche of the world as this devious jewish one of using hitler, the nsdap and germany in general, to bolster sympathy for jews/israel and to cover for their carnage against the world.i have shown sweetie to be a liar several times, but lendman (i believe) is just mistaken and found that using the meme will fortify his point. lendman could have used another example based upon truth.let’s be accurate, shall we?too bad lendman still uses the hitler card, even when attacking israel (and towards jews to a small degree). but the truth is that hitler was disgusted with those two nights and had nothing to do with their instigation or implementation. it was a stain to his party and totally against his direction and desires.what really happened during the crystal night now let us look at what really happened during that fateful night. after <NUM> any harm ever done to any jew in national socialist germany has been described in great detail in many publications and combined with other.stories to give exaggerated figures which have then become the so-called “historical truth.” how strange it is then that despite the passage of more than forty years, no one has established the true extent of the damage done to the jews during the crystal night. all one can learn from history writers is that “all” synagogues were demolished and that “all” shop windows were destroyed. aside from this vague description, one is given almost no details. on the basis of the so-called “historical truth” about the crystal night, the president of the world jewish congress, nahum goldmann, had the chutzpah in <NUM> to claim <NUM> million dollars from german chancellor konrad adenauer as reparation payment for the damage done during that november night. when adenauer asked goldmann for his justification for this enormous request, goldmann replied: “you find the justification yourself! what i want is not the justification but the money.” [note <NUM>] and he got his money! goldmann may have interpreted the willingness of the german chancellor to pay a half billion dollars as proof for the claim that all synagogues had been destroyed. why else would germany be so foolish as to pay for something which never happened? all the same, the “historical truth” that “all” german synagogues were destroyed is a lie. in <NUM> there were approximately <NUM>,<NUM> synagogues in germany, of which only about <NUM> were destroyed or damaged. furthermore, jews owned approximately <NUM>,<NUM> shops and department stores in germany in <NUM>. of this number, only about <NUM>,<NUM> had their windows broken. these figures show just how much the so-called “historical truth” differs from what actually happened. the damage and destruction that did actually occur was, of course, a terrible shame, but the exaggerations, especially by german historians who use them to condemn their own people, are also a shame. history writers tell us that during the crystal night all the jews were frightened, meekly accepted whatever happened to them and watched the destruction of their property with no resistance. the contrary is true. while going through the files on this subject, i found many documents which report precisely just the opposite of what is claimed. the fact is that in many cases jews and their german neighbors fought together against the attackers, pushing them down staircases. street mobs were beaten up and chased away in more than one case. police and party officials were generally on the side of the jews. some jewish community leaders went to police stations the next morning and asked the police to investigate the damage done to their synagogues. the resulting police reports are still available in the files today. also contrary to what we have been told, most jews were not directly affected by these events. in berlin, for example, all of the teachers and pupils of the city’s largest jewish school, which served the entire berlin area, appeared in their classes the next morning without having noticed anything unusual during the previous night. heinemann stern, the jewish principal of that school, wrote in his postwar memoirs that he noticed a burning synagogue on his way to the school on the morning after the crystal night, but he thought it was just an accidental fire. it was only after he arrived at the school that he received a telephone call informing him of the destruction of the previous night. he then went on with his classes of the day and only during the first recess did he take the trouble to inform the entire student body about what had happened. [note <NUM>] how can such evidence be reconciled with the claim by herman graml, a prominent german historian and associate of the munich institute of contemporary history, who wrote: “every single jew was beaten, chased, robbed, insulted and humiliated. the sa tore the jews from their beds, mercilessly beat them in their apartments and then … chased them almost to death … blood flowed everywhere.” [note <NUM>] is it conceivable that thousands of jewish children would be have been sent to school by their parents on the morning after that fateful night if the attacks against jews had been so horrific or extensive? would any parents have let their children go to school if they had thought there was even the slightest danger of them being attacked by roving gangs of sa men? i think the answer is clearly no! deplorable things did indeed happen which were bad enough, but the fantasies of modern historians and history writers such as graml are simply inexcusable.really, isn’t it silly to compare a <NUM> day event, immediately shunned by the very one lendman (and everyone else) blames, to a half-century long apartheid? something tells me that there is a group that trumps the

treasury and have plunged us into a depression will not be contained by the two main political parties. the democratic and republican parties have become little more than squalid clubs of privilege and wealth, whores to money and corporate interests, hostage to a massive arms industry, and so adept at deception and self-delusion they no longer know truth from lies. we will either find our way out of this mess by embracing an uncompromising democratic socialism—one that will insist on massive government relief and work programs, the nationalization of electricity and gas companies, a universal, not-for-profit government health care program, the outlawing of hedge funds, a radical reduction of our bloated military budget and an end to imperial wars—or we will continue to be fleeced and impoverished by our bankrupt elite and shackled and chained by our surveillance state. the free market and globalization, promised as the route to worldwide prosperity, have been exposed as a con game. but this does not mean our corporate masters will disappear. totalitarianism, as george orwell pointed out, is not so much an age of faith as an age of schizophrenia. “a society becomes totalitarian when its structure becomes flagrantly artificial,” orwell wrote, “that is when its ruling class has lost its function but succeeds in clinging to power by force or fraud.” force and fraud are all they have left. they will use both.there is a political shift in europe toward an open confrontation with the corporate state. germany has seen a surge of support for die linke (the left), a political grouping formed <NUM> months ago. it is co-led by the veteran socialist “red” oskar lafontaine, who has built his career on attacking big business. two-thirds of germans in public opinion polls say they agree with all or some of die linke’s platform. the socialist party of the netherlands is on the verge of overtaking the labor party as the main opposition party on the left. greece, beset with street protests and violence by disaffected youths, has seen the rapid rise of the coalition of the radical left. in spain and norway socialists are in power. resurgence is not universal, especially in france and britain, but the shifts toward socialism are significant. corporations have intruded into every facet of life. we eat corporate food. we buy corporate clothes. we drive corporate cars. we buy our vehicular fuel and our heating oil from corporations. we borrow from corporate banks. we invest our retirement savings with corporations. we are entertained, informed and branded by corporations. we work for corporations. the creation of a mercenary army, the privatization of public utilities and our disgusting for-profit health care system are all legacies of the corporate state. these corporations have no loyalty to america or the american worker. they are not tied to nation states. they are vampires. “by now the [commercial] revolution has deprived the mass of consumers of any independent access to the staples of life: clothing, shelter, food, even water,” wendell berry wrote in “the unsettling of america.” “air remains the only necessity that the average user can still get for himself, and the revolution had imposed a heavy tax on that by way of pollution. commercial conquest is far more thorough and final than military defeat.” the corporation is designed to make money without regard to human life, the social good or impact on the environment. corporate laws impose a legal duty on corporate executives to make as much money as possible for shareholders, although many have moved on to fleece shareholders as well. in the <NUM> documentary film “the corporation” the management guru peter drucker says: “if you find an executive who wants to take on social responsibilities, fire him. fast.” a corporation that attempts to engage in social responsibility, that tries to pay workers a decent wage with benefits, that invests its profits to protect the environment and limit pollution, that gives consumers fair deals, can be sued by shareholders. robert monks, the investment manager, says in the film: “the corporation is an externalizing machine, in the same way that a shark is a killing machine. there isn’t any question of malevolence or of will. the enterprise has within it, and the shark has within it, those characteristics that enable it to do that for which it was designed.” ray anderson, the ceo of interface corp., the world’s largest commercial carpet manufacturer, calls the corporation a “present day instrument of destruction” because of its compulsion to “externalize any cost that an unwary or uncaring public will allow it to externalize.” “the notion that we can take and take and take and take, waste and waste, without consequences, is driving the biosphere to destruction,” anderson says. in short, the film, based on joel bakan’s book “the corporation: the pathological pursuit of profit and power,” asserts that the corporation exhibits many of the traits found in people clinically defined as psychopaths.psychologist dr. robert hare lists in the film psychopathic traits and ties them to the behavior of corporations:callous unconcern for the feelings for others;incapacity to maintain enduring relationships;reckless disregard for the safety of others;deceitfulness: repeated lying and conning others for profit;incapacity to experience guilt;failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior.and yet, under the american legal system, corporations have the same legal rights as individuals. they give hundreds of millions of dollars to political candidates, fund the army of some <NUM>,<NUM> lobbyists in washington and thousands more in state capitals to write corporate-friendly legislation, drain taxpayer funds and abolish government oversight. they saturate the airwaves, the internet, newsprint and magazines with advertisements promoting their brands as the friendly face of the corporation. they have high-priced legal teams, millions of employees, skilled public relations firms and thousands of elected officials to ward off public intrusions into their affairs or halt messy lawsuits. they hold a near monopoly on all electronic and printed sources of information. a few media giants—aol-time warner, general electric, viacom, disney and rupert murdoch’s newsgroup—control nearly everything we read, see and hear.“private capital tends to become concentrated in [a] few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of the smaller ones,” albert einstein wrote in <NUM> in the monthly review in explaining why he was a socialist. “the result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. this is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. the consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). it is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.”labor and left-wing activists, especially university students and well-heeled liberals, have failed to unite. this division, which is often based on social rather than economic differences, has long stymied concerted action against ruling elites. it has fractured the american left and rendered it impotent.“large sections of the middle class are being gradually proletarianized; but the important point is that they do not, at any rate not in the first generation, adopt a proletarian outlook,” orwell wrote in <NUM> during the last economic depression. “here i am, for instance, with a bourgeois upbringing and a working-class income. which class do i belong to? economically i belong to the working class, but it is almost impossible for me to think of myself as anything but a member of the bourgeoisie. and supposing i had to take sides, whom should i side with, the upper class which is trying to squeeze me out of existence, or the working class whose manners are not my manners? it is probable that i, personally, in any important issue, would side with the working class. but what about the tens or hundreds of thousands of others who are in approximately the same position? and what about that far larger class, running into millions this time—the office-workers and black-coated employees of all kinds—whose traditions are less definite middle class but who would certainly not thank you if you called them proletarians? all of these people have the same interests and the same enemies as the working class. all are being robbed and bullied by the same system. yet how many of them realize it? when the pinch came nearly all of them would side with their oppressors and against those who ought to be their allies. it is quite easy to imagine a working class crushed down to the worst depths of poverty and still remaining bitterly anti-working-class in sentiment; this being, of course, a ready-made fascist party.”coalitions of environmental, anti-nuclear, anti-capitalist, sustainable-agriculture and anti-globalization forces have coalesced in europe to form and support socialist parties. this has yet to happen in the united states. the left never rallied in significant numbers behind cynthia mckinney or ralph nader. in picking the lesser of two evils, it threw its lot in with a democratic party that backs our imperial wars, empowers the national security state and does the bidding of corporations.if barack obama does not end the flagrant theft of taxpayer funds by corporate slugs and the disgraceful abandonment of our working class, especially as foreclosures and unemployment mount, many in the country will turn in desperation to the far right embodied by groups such as christian radicals. the failure by the left to offer a democratic socialist alternative will mean there will be, in the eyes of many embittered and struggling working- and middle-class americans, no alternative but a perverted christian fascism. the inability to articulate a viable socialism has been our gravest mistake. it will ensure, if this does not soon change, a ruthless totalitarian capitalism.",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE>

ineffective?headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!this piece was originally produced for and posted by mni news.–the european central bank initially received praise for its decision to push the deposit rate below zero as part of its truly unconventional monetary policy. the euro plunged, equities recovered, and euro area manufacturing outperformed its global peers.holders of long-term benchmark bonds have been handsomely rewarded by the ecb’s monetary policy experiment as <NUM>-year yields in germany have resumed their violent decline. and investors expect more, judged by the decline in short-term yields indicating a further interest-rate cut in march of at least <NUM>.<NUM> percentage point.but equity investors in the banking sector have been voting with their feet. this is partly due to fears over new rules allowing regulators to bail in creditors and equity holders. but it is also because of angst that already- beleaguered eurozone financial institutions will suffer further slings and arrows from disappearing net interest-rate margins.adding insult to injury, currency markets have also challenged central banks’ use of negative interest rates. global growth fears have led to the unwinding of euro- and yen-funded carry trades, pushing up the value of the two currencies. the bank of japan’s attempt to curb investor interest in its currency by lowering its deposit rate below zero has so far been no match for the upward pressure on the yen.risk sentiment eventually will recover, and so will traders’ inclination to use the euro and yen as funding currencies. but it is difficult to deny that one of the cornerstones of post-<NUM> monetary policy tools has suffered a severe blow. a large central bank like the ecb can enjoy a first-mover advantage by being the first to push interest rates below zero. but as other major central banks follow, diminishing returns set in, and the disadvantages could begin to outweigh the advantages.the potential downsides from negative interest rates are hotly contested, but we can point to at least two clear examples in the euro area.banks’ return on equity and net margins have recovered somewhat following the sovereign debt crisis in <NUM>. but downside risks are looming, based on the persistent decline in interest rates. based on the historical relationship between return on equity and long-term bond yields, investors currently face negative returns on eurozone bank equities.the money market industry is another victim of low interest rates. assets under management in money market funds have been resilient despite low interest rates. this is likely a result of qe. surging ecb demand for government securities means that the tax from negative interest rates has been lower in money market funds than in government bonds.but these funds’ business model doesn’t make sense at negative interest rates. we estimate that the most of the eligible assets for the eurozone’s money market funds trade with yields below zero. customers will be willing to pay for access to liquidity, but only to an extent, and money market funds won’t survive this interest rate regime for ever.a more fundamental critique levied at negative interest is that the policy leads to behavior opposite of what central banks want. the portfolio rebalancing theory suggests that lowering benchmark yield via quantitative easing (qe) and zero interest rate policy (zirp) pushes investors to move funds further out the risk spectrum. the idea is to encourage money managers and wealth holders to lend their capital to riskier but also more productive projects. we have certainly seen a tremendous search for yield in many markets and asset classes, but deeply negative interest rates could also have perverse effects.plunging bond yields erode returns on the safe and relatively liquid part of investors’ portfolios. they also expose investors to volatility in their core fixed- income holdings that they haven’t been used to, when yields suddenly spike higher. this could curb the desire to seek higher returns in equity and credit markets, the opposite of what central banks sought to achieve with unconventional policies.finally, negative interest rates send the signal that the economy is in dire need of emergency support. this could push consumer and business confidence lower, because it signals that growth will remain low and weak for an extended period.the markets’ questioning of negative interest-rate policies suggests a tactically savvy ecb should rethink its strategy. specifically, the central bank could choose to keep its deposit rate unchanged next month, and compensate with a larger-than-expected extension and increase in qe.but we doubt it will choose this route. de-emphasizing negative interest rates as a policy tool could send the euro higher, further dampening inflation expectations. negative interest rates are an imperfect tool, but our bet is that key central banks will continue to deploy them as long global disinflationary headwinds remain.source:

to the <NUM>’s in north carolina, arriving from scotland. in the late <NUM>’s, my family obtained a meager bit of land in alabama (while it was still a territory… before statehood). they worked that land, surviving many hardships and early deaths. yet they continued to prosper and grow the family, just like you saw in little house on the prairie. my family built that state. my family built the south. my family built this nation. my roots are this nation’s roots.in all the work my dad did to trace our lineage, never once did he mention fighting for slavery, nor did my family own slaves. these southern men fought against unconstitutional aggression from a murderous, tyrannical, thieving empire. these men fought to protect themselves and their families from the bloodthirsty onslaught by northerners who had no business coming into their lands to kill, plunder and devastate for empire. i had many relatives that fought and died for the confederacy. not a single one fought and died for “slavery”. as a matter of fact, many despised slavery because it caused wages to be artificially low. who would pay a decent wage when they could have the work done by slaves? (one could look at today’s prison workers to see the idea at work)the only law that was applicable was the constitution. yet there was no constitutional reason for lincoln’s actions. but there was constitutional rationale for the south to secede. if anyone was breaking any laws, it was lincoln, by starting a war and invading lands that were constitutionally protected to secede if that was their choice.why is the constitution’s preamble significant?it lays out the rationale for the constitution. i chose the one word to highlight, because i can lay claim to that word and its meaning. as a man whose family built this country and has fought and died for this country over hundreds of years, i can explain what “posterity” in this context means. it means my genetic offspring. it means my ancestors and their children and their children and me and my children. it also represents my wife’s family who are descendents of the adams presidents.very few can make these claims and if there is anyone that has a right to speak out about current events intent on erasing our heritage, by god, it is us. and we make no apologies for it.many people come here and legally become citizens. fine and dandy. i am a product of a person coming here from post wwii germany (marrying my father who was stationed there and met her). she is an american now. she isn’t “german-american”. she is american, plain and simple. for that matter, i welcome anyone willing to live and work and become americans. i especially welcome white people to counter the influx of other races intentionally meant to water down the white race majority and to cause further discord and racial tensions. but do it legally and assimilate to become what my mother has become.but when we have corrupt officials, who, in many cases, can not trace any lineage at all to the founding of this country and are dead set on destroying the very basis for what they now benefit from (and are actively hijacking), well, frankly, it pisses me off. people are brought here with no expectation of assimilation. they fly their flags, they speak their foreign languages and we simply make it easier for them to have their own foreign little countries within our borders.we are expected to acquiesce and accommodate them, not the other way around. we are expected (and forced) to pay for their free college and health care (when i don’t get those luxuries). we are expected to lie prostrate and allow them to intimidate us, steal from us and kill us. we are expected to sit back and be politically correct as they take away our heritage and honor. we are expected to believe the “professional historians” as they outright lie and perpetuate the false memes they are brainwashed with. we are expected to allow the media to form false narratives that are directly opposed to truth and the founder’s (my ancestors) dreams/goals for this nation. we are expected to allow their lies to destroy the very essence of what the illegal infiltrators and system-abusers now take advantage of, yet belittle us while taking that advantage. we are expected to simply sit back and allow our posterity to suffer at the hands of these ungrateful government protected hijackers, who only want a handout, taking advantage of the system that my family built.well, to hell with that.h/t preamble to the u.s. constitution @ vocabulary.comfollow @buelahmanbuelahuh?did i rub you the wrong way or stroke you just right?

record number of states can vote to legalize weed this fallheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!originally published at blog.norml.orgthose of us who support the full legalization of marijuana are greatly benefiting from political reforms adopted during what is frequently referred to as the progressive era in this country.the principal objective of the progressive movement was eliminating corruption in government, and to accomplish that goal, proponents sought ways to take down the powerful and corrupt political bosses and to provide access by ordinary americans to the political system – a concept called direct democracy, as contrasted to representative democracy.it was during this period that the concept of direct primaries to nominate candidates for public office, direct election of u.s. senators, and universal suffrage for women gained traction. and, most important to our work, the procedures known as referendum and initiatives began to be adopted in several states.in <NUM>, oregon was the first state to adopt the option of initiative and referendum to change public policy, permitting citizens to directly introduce or approve proposed laws or constitutional amendments. this process was called an initiative if the change originated by action of citizens, without the involvement of the legislature, and as a referendum if it originated from the legislature but was referred to the voters to decide.by <NUM>, a total of <NUM> states had adopted provisions modeled on the oregon system. today, a total of <NUM> states offer a voter initiative. in the rest of the states, the only avenue to change public policy is through the state legislature.this brief history of direct democracy is relevant today because it is this access to direct political action by voters that has allowed marijuana legalization to move forward, years earlier than would have been politically possible through the action of state legislatures.the four states and the district of columbia that have approved full legalization for all adults, and the five states that will be voting on full legalization in november, all rely on voter initiatives. these progressive procedures have worked precisely as they were intended back in the progressive era: they have allowed citizens to go around the establishment to alter the status quo.voter initiatives are unpopular among most elected officials.altering the status quo has not taken place without some legal kicking and screaming by the elected officials in those states. it comes as no surprise that most elected officials do not appreciate the fact that public policies in their states can, when necessary, be changed without their consent.as we approach the end of summer and the coming fall elections, we once again see examples of the extraordinary time and resources many establishment politicians and other anti-marijuana zealots are willing to invest to try to prevent citizens in their states from voting directly on marijuana policy.the reason, of course, is obvious. according to recent national polls, a clear majority of the american public (between <NUM> and <NUM> percent) supports an end to marijuana prohibition. if given the opportunity to vote on the issue, they will vote to legalize marijuana.elected officials, who otherwise claim to represent the will of the voters in their states, and other self-appointed moral guardians, go to great lengths to try to stop the votes from happening.democracy is something they support so long as the public favors the same policies they favor. when the public gets out ahead of the establishment, democracy be damned; they will use any tools available, including procedural and constitutional challenges, to avoid allowing the voters to decide the issue.full legalization proposals.we will have full legalization measures on the ballot in five states this fall: maine, massachusetts, nevada, arizona, and california. a sixth, michigan, would have qualified but for last-minute legislation.in several of the states with pending initiatives, establishment prohibitionists have gone to court in a desperate effort to get the courts to intervene to keep the measures off the ballot.in maine, secretary of state matthew dunlap attempted to invalidate a significant number of the signatures gathered by the campaign to regulate marijuana like alcohol in maine, arguing that the signature of a single notary did not match the one on file with the state. fortunately, superior court justice michaela murphy overruled dunlap’s decision. when the signatures were recounted, the measure, question <NUM>, qualified for the ballot.in massachusetts, once the secretary of state had qualified the legalization initiative for the ballot, a group of prohibitionists calling themselves the safe and healthy massachusetts campaign sued to have the measure removed from the ballot, claiming it violated the constitutional limitation prohibiting an initiative from dealing with two unrelated topics. this challenge was subsequently dismissed by the massachusetts supreme judicial court, and the measure, question <NUM>, will now appear on the november ballot.in arizona, a group calling itself arizonans for responsible drug policy — including two prominent country prosecutors and the arizona chamber of commerce — filed suit to try to keep the legalization initiative off the ballot, after it had been qualified by the secretary of state. the group claimed that the <NUM>-word summary (a limit set by statute) did not accurately reflect everything contained in the <NUM>-page proposal. maricopa county superior court judge jo lynn gentry rejected the argument and approved the measure, proposition <NUM>, for the ballot.in california — the big enchilada for the <NUM> elections and a state in which opponents to an initiative are permitted to include on the ballot their reasons for opposing the proposal — it was the proponents who went to court. the yes on <NUM> advocates successfully challenged all six arguments that opponents had wanted to appear on the ballot, and superior court judge shelleyanne w.l. chang found all six “false and misleading.” she ordered the opponents to modify their arguments, most of which falsely claimed the initiative would permit pro-marijuana ads to appear on radio and television and would appeal to children.and in michigan, where proponents, mi legalize, had turned in a sufficient number of signatures (more than <NUM>,<NUM>) to qualify a legalization measure for the ballot, the state legislature quickly rammed through a new law in june declaring signatures older than <NUM> days to be invalid, leaving proponents shy of the required number of signatures. proponents have filed suit against the state, challenging the new limitations on constitutional grounds, but it appears the appeal will not be decided in time for the initiative to appear on the <NUM> ballot, even if the appeal succeeds.of the five full-legalization initiatives that will appear on the ballot this fall, only the nevada initiative, question <NUM>, was free from a court challenge. nevada secretary of state ross miller certified the proposal for the ballot at the end of <NUM>. while there are certainly organized opponents, none elected to challenge the measure in court.moving forward.in the short term, proponents of legalization will continue to focus efforts in the states that offer the option of a voter initiative. so long as our elected officials, and the establishment interests they represent, continue to support the status quo of prohibition, it makes sense strategically to bypass the state legislature where possible.but that is a strategy that must eventually evolve, as <NUM> states simply do not offer that option. for that half of the country, we will have to win the old-fashioned way: by building majority support among state legislators to pass the proposal through the legislature.it’s a significant challenge for sure, but as we’ve demonstrated with the drive to legalize medical marijuana, after a few more states have adopted legalization by voter initiative, enacting legalization by statute will become more realistic.for those who live in one of the <NUM> states without an initiative process, we must continue the painfully slow process of convincing individual legislators that prohibition of marijuana is a failed public policy and that full legalization makes sense.many already understand this but continue to fear being labeled “soft on drugs” should they acknowledge the obvious. it is frustrating to have to win over supporters one at a time, but each year it becomes easier as public support for legalization continues to increase, and elected officials ignore the wishes of their constituents at their own peril.___________________________________________________________this column first ran on

administration of the non-psychotropic cannabinoid cannabidiol (cbd) leads to improvement in bone fracture healing, according to preclinical data published online ahead of print in the journal of bone

reported, “cbd markedly enhanced the biomechanical properties of the healing femora after <NUM> weeks.”authors also evaluated the administration of thc and cbd together, but reported that this combined preparation was “not advantageous” over cbd alone — indicating that the plant’s potential bone-stimulating properties are primarily specific to cannabidiol.they concluded: “cbd alone is sufficiently effective in enhancing fracture healing. … multiple experimental and clinical trials have portrayed cbd as a safe agent suggesting further studies in humans to assess its usefulness for improving fracture healing.”researchers have previously acknowledged that endogenous cannabinoids stimulate bone formation and inhibit bone loss, potentially paving the way for the future use of

blockchain stocks are next!hiding in plain sightmark reports on a secret societywhere women act like womenand men behave like men.shockingly, they love each otherand are very happy.(see makow comment below – satanists attacking basic laws of nature.)by mark(henrymakow.com)i am one of the very fortunate few because my wife is a stunner, and not just in looks. she’s a real woman and not some money-loving narcissistic career-focused sleep around that many women are. her idea of a career is being at home looking after her man. she loves to cook, take care of the place, loves my gorgeous german shepherd and they are best friends too.she loves my family and close friends, hangs about with women who are similar in their ideas (and i get on well with their husbands because they too are real men). they don’t all use anti-social media, they meet and talk about nice things, shun violence in films, don’t gossip, and all of them love to wear nice dresses and shoes, nice hair, and make up. they look and act like women.my wife is still young and has not one single tattoo on her body, no pierced anything. i have never heard her use bad language, and not once have i had a row with her.she’s not perfect, nobody is, but she’s as close to perfection you can find these days. she’ll also get into the garden and work the plants and flowers while i do all the man work, heavy lifting and other dirty jobs.(trendy modern males, aka hipster)that’s what women really want, a real man and not some confused socially engineered pussy who thinks male anatomy is something he wants inside him. i am self employed and support my wide; she stays at home and takes care of business there. i often receive comments from male friends asking how i found such a lovely person and get asked “does she have a sister?”i know how fortunate i am to have a loving and caring wife who looks up to her man. i am the head of the house and head of the relationship. say that to a feminist and you’ll receive a load of vile abusive speech because those idiots have no clue about what being a woman is all about. i take care of my wife and love her so much that no other woman, nobody, could even make me slightly tempted to go astray and sleep with her, not ever!imagining my gay lifecompare this to life as a gay person. i am not hating gays at all, i just hate what they do and how now they have so many ‘special rights’.so…i come home to steve, he gives me a kiss and asks how my day was. there’s no dinner on the table and the home looks almost and feels like a museum because that feminine touch is missing (even though they act or think they act feminine they can’t ever be the same as a woman.) he’s also a career and money driven man.he likely has met up with someone else who wants unsolicited sex today, at least on some phone app to see what’s out there, keeping his ‘options’ open. we are off out later to meet more ‘friends’ who will likely bitch about everything, flirt like crazy with each others partners (maybe even take some of them back home for a group session later on.)secretly we feel very empty because we know something isn’t right, something is missing.. that could be the natural desire fighting in the back of our minds, the need for a woman. then we get to the very unnatural part of our evening and have sex, two males each with the exact same organs and anatomy making love, not able to create anything other than confusion. what is that really all about?i can’t imagine living with a man (excuse for one) who gets into bed with me at night, says he loves me, and no doubt like most gays sleeps around like crazy and passes on whatever disease from one person to the next. then i can’t have children, he’s not going to feel the way my wife does about me, never, and i don’t feel that way about him and what a strange future to think that if it lasts you’ll grow old and gay (and gray) together.yep, society with its so-called ‘leaders’ have really screwed up what god put in place, the marriage arrangement of male and female, say that to a lot of people and get a load of abuse, especially from feminists who even if they do believe in god will say it’s not a “he” god is a “she”. nice one all the leaders of the illuminati for totally messing up the minds of many.hope for single menthere is hope but first you have to be a man. you have to stop looking at porn and thinking sex is all there is to a relationship. that’s immediate doom if you want a long lasting and happy relationship. you have to start looking in the right places, not night clubs, dating sites, or slutty milfs and cougars. you need a good woman with a christian faith, yes that’s right i said christian.believe me, if a woman follows bible principles she’ll respect and love you, so long as she’s true to her faith and loves god. god created us all and knows what’s best so if she loves him and is qualities, she’ll love you, so long as you imitate the qualities of god. now you’re likely thinking, you need god to get a woman?well no, but trust me, my wife is the only woman i have ever known who loved god. compared to previous partners who said that was stupid and evolution is the answer for life on earth, she’s by far way ahead of them. a christian woman is humble, loving towards all, especially her man and children, does not care for the things in the world, does not want multiple partners. she does want a long lasting relationship. show her you are the man and can take the lead and you’ll get back a hundred fold of woman.—-makow comment: mark is describing masculinity and femininity which mark is describing masculinity and femininity which reflect the fundamental active and passive principles in nature. t he cabalist black magicians are inverting this basic yin yang balance in nature in order to reengineer humanity to be their servants. the protocols of zion (<NUM>) state: “we will destroy every collective force but our own.” this is how they destroy the nuclear family .i have downplayed sex but intercourse is central in male-female bonding. intercourse is the ultimate act of surrender for a woman and possession for a man. passive- active = immutable bond. vaginal orgasm is essential. by encouraging unsatisfying homosexual hook ups and anal intercourse, women are being deprived of orgasms and love by the satanists who

timeheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!part <NUM> of a messagereceived by mercedes kirkelon september <NUM>, <NUM>hello everyone,this is mary magdalene. thank you to all of you who are listening and all of you who will be receiving this message in the future. i am so very happy to connect with all of you.i wish to say a little bit about myself at this point. some of you may already know this and some of you may be less familiar with what i’m about to share. i feel like it’s important to begin from this base of understanding about me and what i am bringing through at this time.many of you are familiar with me as a person who was recorded in the bible as one of the followers of jesus. my preferred way to refer to jesus is through the name yeshua, which is his aramaic name. aramaic was the language we were speaking at the time of his and my incarnation, two thousand years ago. so i will be referring to him as yeshua, but this is the same one that many of you know as jesus.my relationship with yeshua was a very sacred relationship. everyone who was touched by him, who was involved with him in any way, had a sacred relationship with him. i had the great, great blessing and tremendous gift to be very close to him, in fact to be in sacred relationship with him. this is something i have explained in detail in the book mary magdalene beckons: join the river of love. this is something that was not recorded in the bible, for various reasons. the bible was recorded long after our lifetimes. those who decided what would and what would not be included in the bible had their own decisions they were making and their own purposes. as part of that, it was decided that my story would largely not be included, except in very skeletal form.but in fact, it is the case that i was yeshua’s partner and we were in sacred relationship together. the reason for this is quite deep, quite complex. one aspect of it is that we both had work—very, very profound and important spiritual work—that we were bringing forth. it was understood that my part of this was to bring forth what i refer to as the divine feminine, or the feminine face of god. i was incarnated with yeshua as an example and a modeling of the union of divine masculine and divine feminine, in the form of a human man and woman.but we also understood—yeshua and myself, and others as well—that the world at that time was not ready for this aspect of our work and the teaching that we were bringing forth—the aspect of the divine feminine, the aspect of sacred relationship, the aspect of god having attributes or aspects that were both masculine and feminine. (another way of saying this is father-mother-god.) at that time, two thousand years ago, the world was not prepared for this. we understood this. even back when we were both physically incarnated, we knew that it would be two thousand years before the world was ready. that time has come. this is the time now. not only is the world ready to receive the divine in feminine form, and to receive my teaching of the divine feminine, but the world needs this. receiving the divine feminine is very crucial to your time period right now.there are many who are aware of this. i am not the first to say this and this occasion is certainly not the first time of this being stated. many, many people who are aware, who are conscious, and many people who are tuned into higher beings are quite cognizant of this, that this is the time of the divine feminine coming through and coming forth, and that this is absolutely necessary right now.this is one of the reasons why i have been coming through to mercedes, as well as to other people. part of my work is to be a leader in the transformation that humans are in the process of undergoing. this is a transformation from having the divine masculine as the predominant message you received and incarnated for a very long time. that message has predominated both in terms of your spirituality and also in terms of your more mundane world and aspects of that world—your politics, culture, education, and personal development. all of these have been quite dominated by the masculine, what you could call the divine masculine. now it is time for the divine feminine to come forth, to be incarnated, to be understood, and for all of you—men and women alike—to become strong in the feminine, so that you can come into balance between the masculine and the feminine.first and foremost, this must happen within yourselves. you all have your own inner feminine and masculine, which is a reflection or manifestation of the divine feminine and divine masculine. for all of you, this is where the work originates, within yourselves. for many of you, this will require strengthening the feminine, because this has not been supported and developed for a very, very long time. even those of you who feel great love of the feminine and the divine feminine, who feel very positively oriented toward the feminine, even you often have work within yourselves to do to strengthen your inner feminine. this is very practical work. there are very practical arenas that need to be developed for this to become strong, because it has been withheld from you, in so many ways, for so very long.as i talked about in the messages that are recorded in the book mary magdalene beckons, there are three primary arenas where the feminine needs to be strong. it is within these three arenas that many people need to examine themselves and see what work they may have to do to complete the strengthening of the feminine within. this is so important for people to do at this time. first and foremost, this is work for you to do with yourself, for your own strengthening and balancing. secondly, this work needs to be done for your sacred relationships you will be engaging in your life, that these can come into balance. the third very important reason is that you are not only doing this work for yourself. you do this as service to humanity, for your whole world. as you transform, as you strengthen and develop and grow yourself, you are affecting what is accessible for people, what is available to people, and what is becoming strong for your whole world. any time you do growth and transformation work for yourself, it affects everyone. that is very, very important at this time.you are all at a very critical juncture, where there is great opportunity opening up for your world, and for human beings, in particular, to transition into a higher level of consciousness. this will be reflected in a higher dimension of reality coming in and being the realm that you all inhabit, that you know, that you live in and are manifesting in. this is the great opportunity you have at this time. those of you who are on your spiritual path, who are light-workers, very likely those of you who are listening to me at this time, many of you are quite aware of this. i, and so many beings of the higher realms, thank you for all that you are doing to support this amazing transformation that is underway in your world. this is not only affecting the earth. this transformation is so vast and involves so many places in your universe, all of which you are affecting through the spiritual work you are doing. it is most important. we thank all of you for this.i am aware that i have wandered away a bit from where i started, which was explaining about the divine feminine and the arenas through which this manifests within each of you. now i wish to return to that. what i want to explain is that there are these three arenas that are the foundation of the divine feminine within each one of you: the relationship with your physical body, the relationship with your sexuality, and the relationship with your emotions. for each of you, these are the places that i strongly urge you to examine and see what may need strengthening within yourself. this is what i talked about in great depth in the messages i gave in the book mary magdalene beckons, along with my guidance and instruction as to what each of you can do to strengthen these areas. as i said at that time, of these three, the area that is most critical for the most people is the way that you respond to pain.the area of emotions, for many people, is quite confusing. your emotions are truly a gift from the divine that is rather unique to human beings in your realm. yet many of you do not yet fully understand how to receive this gift that has been given to you in the emotional realm and how to work with emotions, particularly your painful emotions. this is the part that is most challenging for many of you. you did not receive help and support and guidance in understanding the pathway of how to respond to painful emotions, how to receive the gift from god that’s being given to you through these emotions, and how to make use of emotions to support your spiritual journey, to support your uniting with god.because you did not receive that instruction and that guidance, and because you do not fully understand it, i especially focused on that in my earlier messages that are recorded in mary magdalene beckons. i gave detailed instruction about how you can respond differently to your painful emotions in a way that will be most supportive of you, most supportive of your spiritual connection, and most supportive of your forward movement in your spiritual evolution. i did this because, from my vantage point, this is the area that is holding most people back from their spiritual growth in general, and specifically from the incarnation of the divine feminine.this is why i said earlier that while many of you are so positively oriented to the divine feminine and the feminine in all her forms (which is a most wonderful thing), even so, for many of you there may still be work to do in these three arenas, and especially in the emotional arena in terms of how you respond to pain. i urge you to make use of the instruction i have given and to learn these pathways of incarnating the divine feminine, which will support you and help to transform you, and in that process, transform your world.***********************************copyright <NUM> mercedes kirkel,

tackle anxietyheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!i don’t know about you, but life seems pretty stressful at the moment. so, these suggestions for ways to help tackle anxiety from health and fitness expert, and former schoolteacher, brian keane couldn’t have come at a better time.anxiety is one of the most common mental health issues. according to a three-year study by the office of national statistics (http://bit.ly/<NUM>pziags), women are more likely to feel anxious compared to men and those who registered as the most anxious were aged between <NUM> and <NUM>. (the ons is unable to collect information on clinically diagnosed cases of anxiety and depression.)brian keane said he suffered from anxiety while working as a teacher. he found himself having sleepless nights and consistently worried about his performance at work. for four years brian worried about his sleep pattern and his working life, which resulted in him consuming sugary foods and drinks to maintain his energy.brian said: “i always thought anxiety meant that you didn’t have your life together – regardless of what you may see, nobody has every area of their life together – and my only experience with anxiety was when colleagues would get signed off work due to stress.“i didn’t have enough self-awareness to realise that it’s something that all of us face at some time or another and for some people, it’s chronic and affects them every single day. for others, it can be chemically induced – too much caffeine, alcohol and drugs. regardless, the more people i meet, the more i realise that everyone experiences anxiety in some way, shape or form“there are some serious cases of anxiety, and if you have suffered any major physical or mental trauma or have a hormonal imbalance, it would be probably best to consult your physician. however, i hope by sharing my own experiences and strategies, i will ultimately support you in managing any kind of day-to-day anxiety or worry that may be limiting you in any aspect of your own life.”brian keane’s new book the fitness mindset, which achieved eight weeks at the top of the amazon bestseller’s chart, has tips on improving fitness and how to achieve a mindset to overcome obstacles such as anxiety and stress. it addresses tactics brian has discovered when working to overcome his own anxiety, below are some of the top tips he has discovered.recognise the source of your anxiety. ‘find the source, fix the problem’. for some of us, it is as simple as cutting off the source of anxiety. in my case, there were certain people in my life who just made me feel ‘off’. i felt more insecure around them, and even though i called them friends, in truth, they weren’t.if there are people in your life that make you feel this way, brian recommends minimising the amount of time you spend with them, or cut them off completely. sometimes, it’s as simple as finding the people who make you feel happy and spending more time with them.train, exercise or meditate. brian said: “for years, i used the gym and my training as an outlet, so they always acted as plasters that temporarily healed the problem. if i felt i was on the edge, i never dealt with it or asked myself who or what was making me feel this way. i just went to the gym. i was effectively ‘self-medicating’ with exercise.“in my opinion, it’s actually the best way to reduce short, as well as long- term anxiety, but it’s imperative to follow step one and then use training, exercise and meditation as ways to support you and not just put a lid over the real problem.”don’t eat foods that make your anxiety worse. brian said: “knowing how certain foods can send my body into a spiral of ‘fight or flight’ has helped support me massively over the past few years. if your body is intolerant or allergic to certain foods, or if you react to certain additives, flavourings and preservatives that can be found in heavily processed food, then it’s worth keeping note of how you feel if these ingredients feature heavily in your diet.“for example, i know if i eat too much dairy, sugar or gluten, my brain will feel foggy the next day and i won’t have the same steady energy and mood that i normally have. everyone reacts differently to certain foods and ingredients, so experiment with it yourself.“i’ve largely eliminated these ingredients and foods and very rarely get any physiologicalanxiety issues anymore. if you still find yourself getting edgy and anxious for no apparent reason – it’s not about money, a relationship or a job and you just feel ‘off’ – then i highly recommend having a look at your nutrition and checking if certain foods you consume are causing you to feel this way.”you can view the fitness mindset on amazon. it is published by

from a channeled reading with a client, who graciously agreed to share this portion because of the universal nature and profundity of mary’s responses.]question: my question has to do with releasing shame. all my life i’ve felt like i’m not good enough, or i’m bad, or something’s wrong with me. i’m currently going through therapy for a substance-abuse problem and healing that. i think a big part of that healing is releasing my shame. any guidance you can give me on that would be helpful.mary magdalene: this is very wonderful that you have identified the connection between shame and using substances. you’re getting to a very deep level and that is where the healing can occur. i acknowledge you for your awareness of the connection between these and your openness to healing the shame that you carry.are there particular arenas in your life that you feel or experience shame?questioner: a big one is that i even have this substance-abuse problem. i feel so shameful about it, like i’m wrong and bad. it’s a substance abuse to prescription medications that got out of hand and now i’m working on it. i feel so much shame that i’ve spent the last ten years of my life with this substance-abuse problem.mary magdalene: what were these medications originally prescribed for?questioner: it was for attention deficit disorder. i’m really sensitive and it helped me to kind of shut off my feelings so i could focus and do work. sometimes i think i’m not cut out for this world: i’m too sensitive, too emotional. i can’t be like that if i need to work and do the practical things of life. so that’s what it was prescribed for. but i’m at a point now where i don’t want to take the medication any more. i want to love and respect my body.mary magdalene: so is it simply that you’re wanting to get off the medication that’s been prescribed? or have you taken the medication in ways that it wasn’t prescribed.questioner: both. i’ve taken it in ways that weren’t prescribed and i’m working with a therapist to get off of it. it’s only in the past two months that i’ve been able to acknowledge this and been honest about it. so i’d like any guidance about getting off of it, but also help with this shame i feel around it.there’s another shame, too, that started when i was really young. this was the first shame, which i’m just starting to realize. when i was really young, like still in diapers, i masturbated. growing up in a catholic household, i knew that it was so shameful. and i still feel so much shame around that now. i was so young; i don’t know why i did it.mary magdalene: thank you for speaking this. when one has shame, even speaking it is difficult because there is so much fear about being ostracized, being abandoned if you show people the part of yourself that you feel shame for. so speaking about it is the beginning of healing. it shows that, first, you’ve become aware and honest with yourself that this is what’s going on, that you have these areas that you have shame about. then you begin to find people who you can trust, who it’s safe to share this with and open up this part of yourself to them. that, in and of itself, is a great step of healing.you need to have discernment in speaking to others about this. it is important to only open yourself up with people who you discern that are safe. there are people who it may not be safe to open up to, people who may not understand or hold these events in the same way you do. it is not necessary or even wise for you to open up to those people. you can be in choice about who the people are who are safe for you to open up to, the people who will be supportive for you to open up to, who actually will help you in the ways that you are wanting help. so be very aware of your choice and start to empower yourself to be in choice rather than being at the effect of random responses from random individuals.how does that part feel to you?questioner: that feels good. that gives me a lot of security and guidance.mary magdalene: yes. this is the beginning of reclaiming your own personal power. when there’s shame, you have given away a part of your power to someone or some entity that you probably trusted. now, at the stage of life you’re currently in, you may realize that they weren’t entirely trustable or they weren’t entirely for your highest good. they gave you messages that what you were doing was bad, wrong, sinful, evil, or that somehow you, yourself, were bad, wrong, sinful, evil, or deficient, not right, not good enough because you were engaging certain behaviors.this is a very sad state of affairs. it is a very third-dimensional issue because in the third-dimensional consciousness there is a very strong belief in these dualities of good-bad, right-wrong, evil-godly, those kinds of things. at the higher dimensions, we see things very differently. we see those kinds of dualities as quite destructive, quite harmful to people’s spiritual growth and their spiritual path.part of the spiritual process at the third dimension is realizing that many people have been programmed with this kind of thinking that certain things are good and certain things are bad; certain things are godly and certain things are ungodly; that kind of thing. those beliefs are not a given. it is a choice to hold such beliefs.i would like to suggest a very different possibility, which from my point of view is part of the transcendence of the third dimension and moving into a higher-dimensional consciousness. that possibility is to see that there is no such thing as good-bad. there is no such thing as right-wrong. all there are is experiences that are either supporting you or not supporting you in your divine growth and unfoldment.when you were very young and you were touching yourself or experiencing your sexual energy through forms of touch and self-pleasuring in whatever way you did, this certainly was not bad or wrong in any way at all, from my point of view. i see it as a completely natural thing to do because you were becoming aware of your physical body and your energy—including your sexual energy, which is connected to your physical body. you were exploring that. to me that is as healthy as learning how to walk, where you’re exploring your physical body and its possibilities for mobility. no one said you were bad or wrong or evil for exploring movement and walking. i certainly don’t see you as any more bad, wrong, or evil for learning about and exploring your sexual energy and your physical sexuality.i see it as most unfortunate that institutions, such as the catholic church, have promoted this belief that you are bad, wrong, sinful, or whatever else for doing what i consider to be not only a very natural thing but a healthy thing. sexuality is part of who we are. it’s no more evil than your appetite for food. people don’t call being hungry and having a meal evil. hunger is simply an energy you have in your body that’s connected to physical systems that are natural to your body. the same is true of sexuality.however, sexuality has the potential for connecting you with god in a very profound way, a way that for most people is much more profound than most of your other bodily functions. in fact, this is why religious institutions have tried to convince people that sexuality is bad, wrong, or whatever. if you did not have that belief, if you believed or understood that your sexuality is natural, healthy, important, and a vital part of your life of connection to god, you would be a naturally empowered person—empowered to transcend the limitations of the third dimension and third-dimensional thinking. those institutions have not wanted people to become empowered in that way, because they benefited from people’s separation from their own power, people’s obedience to them and placing them in a position of power.this is all part of the third-dimensional legacy. it’s all part of what beings are learning about and learning to transcend and grow beyond in their experience in coming to earth. not only is it part of your spiritual path to explore your sexuality, but it is part of your spiritual path to go beyond the limitations of the thinking that says your sexuality is shameful or sinful in any way, to go beyond being limited by this kind of belief structure.so from my point of view, in many ways you are right on course. you’re having your experience of having been limited by having taken on these belief systems, which was probably a very natural, understandable thing to do because you encountered them as a child. very likely, the ones who you were trusting to discern for you which beliefs were supportive for you to take on believed this. so you took it on because they believed it.but now you are an adult. you are growing and maturing spiritually. this is your time to become aware and conscious of what you choose to believe, what you choose to follow, what ideas you choose to empower as things that seem true, in the sense that they are consistent with your own experience and your own guidance.i am guessing from what you’ve said that you no longer ascribe to the beliefs that sexuality or even masturbation is inherently wrong or bad or sinful, and yet you are struggling with earlier programming. is that right?questioner: correct.mary magdalene: even this kind of conversation can be immensely helpful in understanding that that is just one option amongst many, many options. from my point of view, you were probably a sensitive child. your awareness of energy was probably very high. so you were naturally aware of your sexual energy at a young age, possibly younger than many other people. and you were empowering yourself to explore this. these are all very wonderful things, from my point of view. there is certainly no harm, that i am aware of, that can come to a child from exploring their sexuality, masturbating, and having orgasms. but because of their programming, other individuals—very likely including your family members—may have been uncomfortable with this. it may have been in conflict with their beliefs, or the level of shame that they carried, or their comfort around sexuality altogether, because of the programming they received and ascribed to.in fact, the problem was probably much more on the part of those who told you that you were wrong. maybe they didn’t even tell you that. maybe they just were experiencing that within themselves. and because you are a very sensitive being, you picked up on their discomfort, their conflict, and their beliefs. and you took that on.does that seem accurate?questioner: that’s exactly how it seems.mary magdalene: so the first part is to realize that these were really their issues, their difficulty, their challenges that you took on, not your own. you were simply being your own natural, sensitive self.what’s important is to realize that the decision of yours to take on their issues as your own issues was your choice. of course you were very young and it is natural to do things like that when you are young. but nevertheless it was a choice.now you have the choice to no longer continue to take on those beliefs or those conflicts that others are carrying. can you sense this in yourself?questioner: yes, absolutely.mary magdalene: again, it does not mean that you need to go telling everyone you meet that you feel differently or that you have a different point of view. that may not be supportive. you are in choice about who you share this with. but you can certainly do this for yourself in relationship to these arenas. you can do this relative to sexuality. and you can also do this relative to your use of the medicine that you were taking.i have been shown very strongly that whenever a being makes a choice, there are always very wonderful, or you could say beautiful, reasons for that choice. those reasons are what i have called your “inner divine qualities.” when you made the choice to first take the medicine, and then later to take it more than was being prescribed, you had very important reasons why you made that choice. it doesn’t mean that the outcome of that choice—the outcome of the behaviors that you chose to engage—are ones that you are pleased about. it could be that you look at the outcome of those behaviors and you regret that choice. you regret that you chose to act upon your motivations in that particular way. but regret and shame are very different things.regret is part of the human experience. humans makes choices. in retrospect, some of the choices you are happy about and some of the choices you are not happy about. both serve your growth. so it is fine to make choices that you are not happy about. that is part of the growth process.when you realize you’ve made choices you’re not happy about, most humans experience regret. but if you have been given the program that whenever you feel regret it means you’re a bad person, then very likely that regret will turn into shame. shame is saying “there’s something defective about me because i made this choice, or i took this action.” that is based on a combination of regret and judgment. you’re making judgments about yourself, such as: “i should have known better.” “i should have been stronger.” “i shouldn’t have been vulnerable to this kind of artificial support.”are you making those kinds of judgments about yourself?questioner: yes.mary magdalene: are there other judgments that you’re making, too?questioner: it tends to be the same things: “i shouldn’t have done that.” “i should be stronger.” “i shouldn’t be so emotional.” …mary magdalene: “i should know better.” “i should be more stable.” “i should be more like other people who don’t have these problems.”those kinds of things?questioner: absolutely.mary magdalene: yes. “there’s something the matter with me that i can’t do it right.”questioner: exactly.mary magdalene: when you set all those judgments aside, are you able to feel something different in terms of an emotion, other than shame, relative to your taking this medicine?questioner: yes.mary magdalene: what is it that comes up?questioner: more compassion.mary magdalene: and perhaps regret or sadness for the situation that you’re in?questioner: yes, sadness and regret. but especially when you were talking about the inner divine qualities, then i feel compassion.mary magdalene: yes. there are two things. you have sadness that engaging with these medicines hasn’t supported you in the way that you were hoping. is that true?questioner: correct.mary magdalene: and it has had some negative ramifications. is that right?questioner: yes.mary magdalene: yes.what i would like to look at are the inner divine qualities that you were hoping to fulfill by taking this medicine, and even taking more than was prescribed. what were you hoping to accomplish by that, consciously or unconsciously?questioner: power over myself—being powerful. also being productive, getting stuff done. being able to connect with people. i think i also used the medicine to mask some depression, as well. so i wanted to be joyful and happy to connect with people, and give that joy and happiness to people.mary magdalene: beautiful! this is the important thing that will help you the most with shame. it is to realize there were very valid, important, and even beautiful reasons why you were making these choices. you wanted to have power over yourself. you wanted to be productive and functional. you wanted to connect with others. you wanted joy in your life. these are wonderful, important things that everyone needs in their life. you were choosing this modality of trying to accomplish these things. perhaps it didn’t work the way that you were hoping. but that doesn’t mean that you are a bad person. it simply means you made a choice that didn’t work out the way that you were hoping.now what you can do is take steps to make a different choice. take steps to get off of the substance, if that’s what you choose to do, or whatever seems like the wisest choice now to accomplish these same things. because it’s still important that you have all of these things: that you feel empowered, that you are functional and productive, that you connect with others, and that you have joy in your life. you still need all of those things. you can simply shift from this self-judgment and paralyzing position of “i’m bad,” to “i tried something. it didn’t work the way i had hoped. now i’m going to look at what else i can do to fulfill these important inner divine qualities.”how does that land with you?questioner: that’s very helpful and feels very healing.mary magdalene: wonderful.hopefully you are finding people who can support you in finding practical steps you can take to fulfill these inner divine qualities, which will support you in better ways than the ways you were trying through the medicine.i highly recommend that you also change your languaging. rather than saying, “i have a substance-abuse problem,”—because you’re labeling yourself as one who’s involved in abuse—say, “i have a problem with my use of this medication. it’s not supporting me. i want to change that.” simply state what is without any judgment.can you feel the difference?questioner: absolutely. yes. (laughing) thank you, that feels so much better.mary magdalene: (laughing) wonderful.questioner: i have another question about depression. i have a big fear of depression. i anticipate having depression as a result of the chemical changes i’m going to have in my body through going off this medication. i think i started to use the medication to mask some depression. it’s really the fatigue and lack of motivation that i don’t like.mary magdalene: yes. so that is wonderful because now you’re getting to the root of the issues that motivated you originally to use the medication. and again, you can look at other options.it may be that you need medication to help you with depression, but you can look at using medication as one option. you can look at which medications would be most helpful, if you choose to engage medication. find someone who can help you with your full spectrum of concerns. you may want to work with someone more naturally oriented, who is open to the use of medications as one option, and who can help you sort through all the various possibilities, as well as your concerns. then they can help you to come up with a holistic program that will be tailored to you and will hopefully help you the best. they can also help you to monitor the program and how it’s working for you. then, if you start with a medication and find out it’s not working the way you hoped, or it has consequences you didn’t realize beforehand, you can make choices about what steps to take.you can also start to look at natural options for handling depression. there may be things in your diet that could change the actual biochemistry in your body. there could be things like exercise. there could be certain social engagements or a support group of some sort or other, working with a therapist or a coach. there may be all kinds of things.so i suggest that you get a support person who you like where they’re coming from, who you trust, and who you feel has the understanding of the full picture, so they can help you to access all the different kinds of resources you may need.questioner: thank you. that’s very helpful.mary magdalene: wonderful.©<NUM> mercedes kirkel, http://www.mercedeskirkel.com, all rights reserved. permission is given to share this message as long as the message is posted in its entirety, nothing has been changed or altered in any way, and mercedes kirkel’s credit of authorship, this copyright notice, and mercedes kirkel’s website (http://www.mercedeskirkel.com) are included.if you would like to receive more messages like this,mercedes kirkel is a #<NUM> best-selling and multi-award-winning author, bringing forth messages and instruction from mary magdalene and other beings of light. her first book, mary magdalene beckons: join the river of love is available at www.marymagdalenebeckons.com. mercedes’s latest book, sublime union: a woman’s sexual odyssey guided by mary magdalene, is available at www.sublime-union.com. all messages and practices are universal and are not affiliated with any religion.to receive ongoing messages from mary magdalene and other beings of light through mercedes, go to www.mercedeskirkel.com and request to be added to the mailing list.mercedes offers workshops and private sessions in the san francisco bay area, ca, including guidance from mary magdalene and other beings of light, heart-source life-and-relationships coaching, light-filled intimacy™ instruction, and spiritual mentoring. she is available in-person or long distance (by phone and skype), or to travel to your location. for more information, go to www.mercedeskirkel.com.note from mercedes: if you feel served by mary magdalene’s messages and would like to make a donation to support the posting of these messages, i would greatly appreciate it. just click on the button below. thanks so much!receive the next book of messages from mary magdalene:sublime union: a woman’s sexual odyssey guided by mary magdalenea sacred sexuality manual and erotic memoircopyright <NUM> mercedes kirkel, http://www.mercedeskirkel.com, all rights reserved. please copy and share this article as long as it is shared in its entirety, including this copyright notice, and the information is not altered, excerpted, or added to;

clear my mind, think of the question or object and this blog is an example of what i get. this blog is a way for me to organize all my thoughts.<NUM>:<NUM> pm – hmm….ok, i am visualizing researchers in a scientific lab, and they are trying to like study the whole fertilization process and trying to determine what genes do what, and i am seeing like this board on the wall. and it will say blue eye, and like have notation beside it, it is not legible to me and written in scientific lingo, and then it will say like brown eyes, blonde hair, like all these different attributes like a person could have. it is a huge list. and they are trying to scientifically figure out how to create humans with certain physical characteristics and intelligence. then the next thing that i see is a couple and they are in a waiting room in a doctors office, and it is like the guy is holding the woman’s hands and she looks like she has been crying. and my impression is that they are wanting a child, they cannot get pregnant, and they are at that desperation phase. the i see a dr. take them back and start to explain different fertility options, and then the doctors are handing the couple a menu, like they can custom order their baby. and it feels to me that dr.’s are preying upon emotions of people who cannot have kids, collecting huge amounts of money for fertility procedures, to fund the bigger picture of studying and learning how to customize babies. i feel like these reality shows are out there to one let people know that all these procedures exist, but secondly, to desensitize you to everything that they are doing. and it is like i am hearing some futuristic slogan of “why adopt, just customize your baby” or something like that. that is all i initially get.q-why do feel many couples are infertile?a-i see a person standing…and they have what looks like these waves, like bombarding their body, even going through their body. and it feels like we are so bombarded with electronic or magnetic waves that it pollutes your body. and that is why i feel like when you are younger it is usually easier to get pregnant than when you are older, and that is in part due to the toxin buildup in your body from these waves that are constantly bombarding it.q-do you feel people today actually select their true genetic mates, based off nature, pheromones and a mate that is a compliment to their own dna? vs. less compatible mates based on other factors.a-i see that as individualized for the person, so some people yes, and some people no. but the thing that i do see is that people with long lasting relationships that are created from their own free choice, are generally more compatible. the less compatible people i feel have very short lived relationships.q-do you see all babies being test tube babies in the future, and if so how long from now.a-for the first part, i do not see all babies being test tube babies, i feel like the test tube babies are more for the wealthy, or people who are able to come up with the funding for it. i feel like it is going to be in the late <NUM>′s or early <NUM>′s, when it is like launched and society starts to accept it. i see there being like a huge controversial thing leading up to it and it will take a while for this to be acceptable, and part of the media now is just to, kind of in small doses, get people familiar with alternative ideas. and i keep feeling there is a huge amount of money to be made in this industry.q-is it motivated by money more than by helping.a-yes, because i just keep feeling that money part of it.q-when does conception start?a-i keep seeing it as when the first cell divides.q-time frame from when sperm meets egg.a-i keep seeing <NUM>, it might be <NUM> minute, but i am leaning towards <NUM> hour.q-define conception, when soul, spirit, life force, whatever enters the cell. what is it?a-i see it as a golden light, shooting into the woman’s stomach, and as a cell divides, it starts to glow, and i feel like it is combination of spirit, with universal knowledge..,that nugget…enters the cell right in that moment when it divides.q-so with in vitro fertilization, the sperm and egg are combined outside the body, does conception still happen without the woman?a-yes, but it is weird, i am getting a picture of a person, and they look like they are catatonic, so i feel like until it is implanted in the woman, like the warmth and personality does not penetrate the embryo. it is like something is not right with the fertilized egg until it is in the woman.q-have children been born, without the use of a mother or surrogate?a-i am getting no, because you still need the placenta to provide nourishment to the baby, and there is no way to replicate that.q-why can human embryos not be implanted into animal host mothers?a-it has something to do with their blood, there is some kind of blood exchange or something with the blood that makes it not possible.q-like why can a primate, not carry a human embryo? is that combination possible?a-i do not know, i just keep getting something about the blood.q-do we pick our own parents when we incarnate?a-hmm..q-i do not feel like we pick our own parents, but we pick like the situation, or circumstances we live in…to complete our life lessons and to spiritually evolve. i feel like on the other side of life we all have the same goal, to evolve to the next dimension, but it is unclear to us now in our earthly bodies. but i think that when we die, all of that becomes very clear.a-is abortion wrong?q-well there is two sides to it, one that is the individuals choice and they have to live with the decision that they made, but then the second side of it is in some ways i feel it might be fate, that maybe it was soul that jumped in too soon, and it just was not ready to incarnate yet. in some ways it is even a life lesson for the person that is experiencing the abortion because i see a person walking around and it is almost like they are hunch backed, with a big weight on their shoulders and they have to carry that emotional weight of that decision forever. and i feel like maybe that is one of their life lessons during their existence.q-is the us or other countries currently producing “menu” babies?a-they are not producing now, but there are other countries studying, and on a map i see the central part of europe lighting up, and also the middle of china lighting up.q-do you see this as a good or bad thing for humanity?a-as soon as you said that, it wasn’t necessarily good or bad, but i heard the phrase “is it moral or immoral” and then i see these like wealthy parts of society and everyone looks so similar, i feel like it just takes the randomness out of life. the movie stepford wives keeps playing in my head. it is like everybody is so so similar.q-do you have anything else to add, and what is your impression of this reading.a-i do not have anything else, i think it was a really interesting reading, before this i had never really thought about science going in that direction. as i did the reading i feel uneasy that society could move that way, i feel like it really segregates people, like there is this average population of just like normal folks, and then there is like this elite population of what people define as beautiful people, and it just feels really strange.q-i think there was movie called gattaca with a similar concept, but only the elite could have certain jobs, like there was a lot discrimination, to the natural born.<NUM>:<NUM> pm – link to audiosource:",<DATE>

think of the question or object and this blog is an example of what i get. this blog is a way for me to organize all my thoughts. <NUM>:<NUM> pm today i wanted to do a short response to some questions i recevied on the zimmerman case. so here they are….q. with regards to the trayvon martin case. did it really happened the way zimmerman said it did. did trayvon threw the first punch?a. i definitely see that trayvon was uncomfortable… i also get a suspicious vibe. like martin didn’t do anything yet, but it was because he felt he was being watched. i’m getting an image of someone working security (undercover security at a department store and watching someone (being martin) to make sure they don’t steal something. the person watched, doesn’t realize it at first, but they are “lurking around” and not just going from point a to point b. i just see this lingering….then there comes a point where martin realizes that he is being watched… at that point he gets angry. more that his “lingering” got interrupted more than the straight up fact that he was being watched. i see that he (referring to martin) felt like zimmerman was a rude interruption to something… exactly like he was rudely interrupted.martin got really defensive, and i see him as the first to yell. it was in an irate way. zimmerman didn’t back down and stood there confidently i see martin had the chance to leave then, very early on, and he didn’t take it because he was so angry. at this point i start to hear a lot of foul language.. the f word is being used both ways and i hear the phrase “pissed” and “pissed off” with that focusing more on martin.now i see martin doing some kind of a boxers tip-toe dance and bouncing around. it was like martin knew there was going to be a fight, and he wanted a chance to have the first punch. martin wasn’t scared, he was so full of adrenaline my heart is beating hard. martin was focused.. it does appear that martin did throw the first punch.q. was the screaming trayvon’s?a. as i focus on that i hear martin’s side yelling, but not making words. just sounds as they are fighting. more like a growl. it was as if when he exhaled it was a “sound” rather than a breath.i do see zimmerman yelling… which leads to the next question that was asked…q. zimmerman’s account does not add up. if he had a gun, why would he be screaming for help?a. i see he had a gun, but didn’t want to use it. he was screaming trying to get people to help so martin could be restrained and taken in. i don’t see that he sought out to shoot him. he wanted martin to realize that he was being watched so if he didn’t intend to do some kind of crime (or tell he friends about a possible crime) that his appearance had been known. i keep flashing back to wisteria lane on desperate housewives and feel the neighborhood had a closeness about it as wisteria lane did, so to yell for help feels right and normal.. i see that zimmerman carried a gun like an insurance policy, never really thinking he would ever need to use it. even as he grabbed he was kind of awkward. like he didn’t make a fluid motion for it.and those are the questions i have received so far. it is <NUM>:<NUM>

order- – - – - – -coordinating efforts to preparethe nation for space weather eventsby the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, and to prepare the nation for space weather events, it is hereby ordered as follows:section <NUM>. policy. space weather events, in the form of solar flares, solar energetic particles, and geomagnetic disturbances, occur regularly, some with measurable effects on critical infrastructure systems and technologies, such as the global positioning system (gps), satellite operations and communication, aviation, and the electrical power grid. extreme space weather events — those that could significantly degrade critical infrastructure — could disable large portions of the electrical power grid, resulting in cascading failures that would affect key services such as water supply, healthcare, and transportation. space weather has the potential to simultaneously affect and disrupt health and safety across entire continents. successfully preparing for space weather events is an all-of-nation endeavor that requires partnerships across governments, emergency managers, academia, the media, the insurance industry, non-profits, and the private sector.it is the policy of the united states to prepare for space weather events to minimize the extent of economic loss and human hardship. the federal government must have (<NUM>) the capability to predict and detect a space weather event, (<NUM>) the plans and programs necessary to alert the public and private sectors to enable mitigating actions for an impending space weather event, (<NUM>) the protection and mitigation plans, protocols, and standards required to reduce risks to critical infrastructure prior to and during a credible threat, and (<NUM>) the ability to respond to and recover from the effects of space weather. executive departments and agencies (agencies) must coordinate their efforts to prepare for the effects of space weather events.sec. <NUM>. objectives. this order defines agency roles and responsibilities and directs agencies to take specific actions to prepare the nation for the hazardous effects of space weather. these activities are to be implemented in conjunction with those identified in the <NUM> national space weather action plan (action plan) and any subsequent updates. implementing this order and the action plan will require the federal government to work across agencies and to develop, as appropriate, enhanced and innovative partnerships with state, tribal, and local governments; academia; non-profits; the private sector; and international partners. these efforts will enhance national preparedness and speed the creation of a space-weather-ready nation.sec. <NUM>. coordination.

fukushimaheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!<NUM>:<NUM> pmq.in general what do you see happening in <NUM> with weather manipulation and/or weather wars? is there a way to stop them?a. the first thing i hear in my head is that each storm will be more grandiose that the last. then i see a chess board…as if each side is taking turns back and forth…it looks like they are playing chicken with one another to see who do what. and by saying they’re i am referring to the united states….i want to say japan, but i feel like they are somehow interconnected with china…russia is starting to become a player but they are kind of behind with technology. those are the main counties i see involved.with regards to the weather in <NUM>, i see the northeastern part of the united states being a target with a focus on ny. then i hear a phrase “the surrounding states are just collateral damage”. i see a bunch of swirls on a map that are white indicating blizzard type storms, just one after another, again with a focus on ny. i am getting the reason that there is such an imbalance in the weather is because as we receive an attack that causes inclimate weather, we try to counteract it with these unseasonably warm weather conditions. and even though the result may be storms or tornadoes, it felt that it is less severe than the inclimate weather, and the u.s. is not good at regulating how severe it be. it seems to be full blast in the cold direction or full blast in the hot direction.i see that in the early summer around the end of may, there is going to be really bad storm on the southeast coast, clear from florida up to south carolina, it looks like a bad hurricane and it blows just right up the whole coast. in the summer i see a big line of fire….and it looks to be on the western side of illinois and it spans the whole length of the state. my mind wants to tell me forest fire, but without a map i can’t be sure. in the washington state area i keep seeing icefall, and it looks like big long icicles, and it looks like a severe ice storm in store for that area. when i ask myself if there is a way to “stop them” it looks as if it would be very difficult, the picture in my mind is a group of people in the top of a tower, and there is a mob of people beneath them on the ground, and there is no way to reach the people in the tower (weather manipulators), it is as if they are untouchable. q. why is ny the focus? a. ok i am getting a lot of reasons coming in….one that it is an older city and it is vulnerable, because of it’s position, it is a financial heartbeat of the country, and i see a map of the us and ny is pulsating like a heart. it is really population dense, so a hardship really affects a lot of people.q. please tell us about how the fukushima problems will impact the world. hopefully enough people will focus on healing fukushima that it will avoid any major impact on the earth.a. the first thing i see is litter and the trash washing up on the beaches…i also see a lot of seafoam and at first it seems cool, but as people start to put their hands or feet into it, it has this coating about it that feels like soap scum. the other image i have too is big fishing boats that are in the pacific, are getting a lot of garbage in their fishing nets. i am seeing an image of someone on a boat and they spot what looks like a big school of jellyfish, and when the get close enough to examine it, it is like a ton of these plastic bags. it is like the garbage floats in “schools”. i get that people become very concerned with consuming the fish out of that part of the pacific ocean, to the point where a lot of people in the u.s. won’t even buy it.i also see orange dust in the air over the west coast, and i see these vineyards in california being concerned with the dust on their grapes. it is like it is killing the grapes. it is like dust that comes over in clouds from the pacific, moving in an eastern direction.i see fukushima mainly affecting the countries that are to the east. i mean the water and the air is all tainted but it is much more diluted to the countries to the west of fukushima, so the eastern countries will have the higher effects of radiation and pollution.q. hi, just wondering on news on your red comet? is the red comet ison? or is it yet to come? storms here have been the worst in <NUM> yrs.a. ok when i ask for the name, i am not given a name but i am given a picture. what i see is the earth, this comet (the “red comet’) and the sun. being in perfect alignment right now. and the reason that this comet is hard to see is because it is directly in front of the sun and the brightness of the sun blinds us from it.then i am getting a phrase saying “i haven’t given you a name but i have given you everything you need to know”.q. regarding the latest storm to hit the philippines; was this a man made storm and what was its purpose? i read that the water fueled car was about to be marketed there, could that be one of the reasons for the weather attack?a. i see we were trying to get the phillippines to join us, by getting members of their government to form an allied group, and they resisted. i see this american guy in a suit and he is trying to put his arm around this philippine guy’s shoulder, the philippine guy totally resisted, and the american guy had an arrogance about him and was completely offended. then i see two kids picking at each other, one pokes the other and says “how do you like that?”, and then the other picks back and says “what about that.” and it does look to me that we retaliated because they did not want to be in business with us (us), but i also get this feeling of regret or remorse like it went way too far. there is like some shame and embarrassment associated with it too.when i ask if it was associated to the car, i just see a big field full of oil pumps working, so in my mind the answer is that it was related to the car.<NUM>:<NUM> pm link to audiosource: http://psychicfocus.blogspot.com/<NUM>/<NUM>/<NUM>-earth-changes-weather-fukushima.html",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE>

the explosive death of a sun-like star more than <NUM>,<NUM> light-years away in the constellation of puppis. the image was captured by the hubble space telescope.the space agency released the new picture last friday, observing that such pictures are incredibly uncommon as a result of how rapidly this stage of a star’s life progresses.amazing stellar explosionthe picture reveals the calabash nebula, a red giant, changing into a planetary nebula by explosively shedding its outer layers into space at greater than <NUM>,<NUM> mph, nasa said. the yellow-colored gas can be seen shooting into

egg.credit: esa/hubble & nasa, acknowledgement: judy schmidtlast month, it was revealed that other images captured by hubble were used to make the most accurate observations of the rate of universe’s expansion to date. bright highly-active quasars observed by hubble flicker in illumination and these flickers were used as a gauge to get a very specific measurement of the rate of cosmic enlargement. the team was able to confirm past measurements of the hubble constant, a number that identifies the rate of cosmic expansion.the researchers were able to measure the hubble constant to a precision of <NUM>.<NUM> percent — the most accurate measurement made thus far. prior measurements of the hubble constant utilized cepheid variable stars as “standard candles” to assess cosmic ranges and get the rate of expansion. basically, these stars vary in illumination in a known way, which makes them excellent beacons to analyze.this new study matches these previous measurements of the hubble constant, only more accurately, and verifies the universe is growing faster than cosmic models calculate, adding to the mysterious nature of the universe.—–image credit: esa/hubble & nasa, acknowledgement: judy

treaty leach became convinced the eu was ‘a bureaucratic oligarchy, not a democracy’it was when he first read the full text of the <NUM> maastricht treaty that leach became convinced the eu was “a bureaucratic oligarchy, not a democracy”. he opposed the idea of a “european constitution” that would be designed to centralise power in brussels. and as support grew in the mid-<NUM>s for british membership of the single currency, he became convinced that a “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy could not work for widely differing national economies.in <NUM> – at a time when the prime minister tony blair was positioning the uk to join the euro with the full-hearted support of the cbi and many members of the business establishment – leach founded business for sterling to co-ordinate the case against.the lobby group gradually recruited a thousand chairmen and chief executives to its cause and gathered momentum around the country until the pro-euro side largely faded away. but when asked whether he had personally saved britain from a dangerous fate, leach was self-effacing: “if there was credit it should be spread very, very broadly. i was just the chairman.”on the issue of enlargement, leach remarked that ‘the democratic deficit … gets worse every time there is more europe’in <NUM> he set up open europe, a think-tank dedicated to scrutinising and challenging every aspect of the european project, from the minutiae of financial regulation to the constitutional issues of enlargement, on which leach remarked that “the democratic deficit … gets worse every time there is more europe”.but his approach was constructive. having won the battle against euro membership, he said, “we now want to fight a much longer war to make something good happen.” his vision was of “a much more efficient europe… that britain would be at ease with”: a “neighbourly alliance” in which those nations that wanted to share economic sovereignty and those that just wanted co-operation and trade would be equally welcome.as for the <NUM> referendum on uk membership of the eu, leach condemned what he called “adversarial claptrap” from the opposing politicians, and was guarded in expressing his own preference. in contrast to many voices warning that “brexit” could bring economic disaster, open europe’s research indicated that the impact of british departure could be positive or negative, depending on subsequent trade deals and deregulation measures – but either way was likely to be relatively modest in scale.in an interview for the spectator conducted in february (before david cameron’s “renegotiation” of membership terms) leach spoke of the value of continuing uk pressure for eu reform, and seemed to lean towards remain. he had still made no public declaration when in mid-april, while chairing an open europe debate, he suffered a severe stroke.however, an email he had sent to a friend in march was subsequently published: “we aren’t ever going to sacrifice our democracy, and the eu cannot ever develop a democracy, as it hasn’t got a demos… so it has to be exit, painful though that may temporarily be.”charles guy rodney leach was born in dublin on june <NUM> <NUM>. he was educated at harrow and balliol college, oxford – where he took a first in greats and won all four of the latin and greek verse and prose composition prizes (his older brother colin having won three). he embarked on an academic career, having “never given the slightest thought” to what he might do otherwise. it was the hungarian uprising of <NUM> that jolted him into a wider awareness: he helped to found the oxford-hungarian relief fund for refugee camps, recalling later: “this was the real world and it was a revelation… here were people longing to be free, and it was deeply exciting.”thereafter he decided on a financial career and – as many bright young men did in that era – embarked for canada, where he worked for the brokerage and investment firm of greenshields in montreal, under the tutelage of george cretzianu, a former romanian finance minister who had escaped from the russians.returning to london, leach was recruited into nm rothschild & sons in <NUM> by his oxford friend jacob (now lord) rothschild, who was a junior partner in the family banking house. as a partner from <NUM>, and joint head of corporate finance, leach acquired a reputation as a master of financial complexities: the triumvirate of leach, jacob rothschild and the former barrister philip (later sir philip) shelbourne took the bank to the forefront of city dealmaking, both in the fast-growing eurobond market and in mergers and acquisitions.in the latter sphere, as adviser to the american company leasco in its bid for pergamon press in <NUM>, leach was obliged to face down pergamon’s owner, robert maxwell. the rothschild team rightly suspected false accounting behind pergamon’s reported profits – and leach was invited to discuss the matter at maxwell’s home, headington hall, near oxford. having received sinister warnings about what maxwell might be capable of, leach agreed to attend only on the basis that telephone calls would be made to the mansion at specified times – and if leach did not answer them, the police would be called. maxwell was unperturbed by the condition, appearing to think it quite normal – but he treated leach more respectfully thereafter.in <NUM> leach first came to the attention of the then taipan of jardines in hong kong, henry keswick, when rothschild was called in to defend dairy farm, a local retail chain with valuable property assets, against a hostile takeover bid by jardines’ subsidiary hong kong land. in a bitter battle the bidder eventually prevailed, but leach extracted a rich price.four years later – having become caught up in tensions between jacob and his cousin (sir) evelyn de rothschild, by then chairman of the bank – leach left rothschilds to work for the lebanese financier edmond safra (who had been a rothschilds client) in his swiss-based trade development bank. but when safra sold most of the business in <NUM> to american express, leach left for matheson & co, the london holding company of jardine matheson. its lombard street office became his base of operations for the rest of his life; he was an executive director until he was past <NUM>, squeezing his campaigning activities “between the hours of <NUM>am and <NUM>am and after <NUM>pm, at weekends and on holiday”.as jardines’ financial strategist, and a director of its group companies, leach devised the structure of cross-shareholdings which maintain keswick family control and protect the group against takeover bids. he was also behind the controversial transfer of domicile of group companies from hong kong to bermuda in the mid-<NUM>s and their stock market listing in london as well as hong kong, in anticipation of the transfer of sovereignty to communist china.in <NUM> he returned to the rothschild fold in a non-executive capacity as a director of paris orléans (now rothschild & co), the holding company of the french and british branches of the empire. he was a member of the british library’s board.rodney leach published europe: a concise encyclopedia of the european union in <NUM>. he was created a life peer, as lord leach of fairford, in <NUM>, having been nominated by the conservative leader michael howard in recognition of his european campaigns: one commentator imagined tony blair eyeing the list of nominations and muttering: “not that man leach, dammit.”leach was also a force behind the “no to av” campaign which in <NUM> helped defeat the liberal democrats’ proposal to replace first-past-the-post parliamentary elections with the “alternative vote” system of proportional representation.leach was an avid competitive bridge player at the portland club. he married first, in <NUM>, felicity ballantyne, whom he had met in canada. the marriage was dissolved in <NUM> and he married secondly, in <NUM>, jessica douglas-home, widow of the times editor charles douglas-home.jessica had worked with romanian dissidents before the fall of the soviet empire and was, rodney observed, “more of a revolutionary than me”: it was she who first urged him to immerse himself in the small print of the maastricht treaty. she survives him with two sons and three daughters of the first marriage.lord leach of fairford, born june <NUM> <NUM>, died june <NUM> <NUM>",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,a rothschild passed on

meeting last month.“the nra believes that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms, period,” the group said in a statement. “anyone on a terror watchlist who tries to buy a gun should be thoroughly investigated by the fbi and the sale delayed while the investigation is ongoing. if an investigation uncovers evidence of terrorist activity or involvement, the government should be allowed to immediately go to court, block the sale, and arrest the terrorist. at the same time, due process protections should be put in place that allow law-abiding americans who are wrongly put on a watchlist to be removed.”trump first announced a meeting with the nra to figure out how americans can best arm themselves against terrorist shootings like the one that claimed the lives of <NUM> people and left <NUM> others injured in orlando on sunday. it was the largest mass shooting committed by a single gunman in u.s. history.despite having previously been investigated by the fbi, the orlando gunman was able to legally obtain his firearms. trump blamed the shooting on the obama administration and hillary clinton for failed foreign and national security policies that allowed for the killings and permitted the shooter’s parents to enter the u.s. from afghanistan before he was born in new york some <NUM> years ago.trump’s platform has called for the banning of muslim immigrants until it can be determined how best to deal with the threat of “radical islam.”gun control group everytown for gun safety responded to trump’s statement, saying it hopes for a “meaningful proposal, not another red herring” to come out of his meeting with the nra.in a statement wednesday, everytown president john feinblatt said that everyone should work to close what’s been called the terror loophole or terror gap, which has allowed people with suspected terrorist ties to purchase guns more than <NUM>,<NUM> times since <NUM>.“if we had closed it already, we might have prevented the orlando shooter from getting guns,” feinblatt said. “there have been real ‘terror gap’ proposals on the table for nearly a decade. both the bush and obama administrations have endorsed them. and yet the nra’s leaders have fought them tooth and nail, and their allies in congress have repeatedly voted against them.”the nra, in kind, blamed democrats for blocking reasonable alternatives to the terror watchlist ban, which “respected due process.”the post nra to trump: ‘no guns for terrorists,’ but due process first appeared first on guns.com.source:

russiaheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!as we reported in just the past week, not only has nato accelerated its encirclement of russia, with british soldiers deployed in estonia, us soldiers operating in latvia and canadians in poland, while combat units are being increased in the mediterranean…… but even more troubling, was nato’s assessment that it may now have grounds to attack russia when it announced that if a nato member country becomes the victim of a cyber attack by persons in a non-nato country such as russia or china, then nato’s article v “collective defense” provision requires each nato member country to join that nato member country if it decides to strike back against the attacking country.specifically, nato is alleging that because russian hackers had copied the emails on hillary clinton’s home computer, this action of someone in russia taking advantage of her having privatized her u.s. state department communications to her unsecured home computer and of such a russian’s then snooping into the u.s. state department business that was stored on it,might constitute a russian attack against the united states of america, and would, if the u.s. president declares it to be a russian invasion of the u.s., trigger nato’s mutual-defense clause and so require all nato nations to join with the u.s. government in going to war against russia, if the u.s. government so decides.also recall that the attack on the dnc servers which leaked the democrats confidential files on trump and hillary donors lists were also blamed on “russian government hackers”, before it emerged that the act was the result of one solitary non-russian hacker, but not before the us once again tried to escalate a development which may have culminated with war with russia!throughout all of these escalations, the popular narrative spun by the “democratic” media was a simple one: it was russia that was provoking nato, not nato’s aggressive military actions on the border with russia that were the cause of soaring geopolitical tension. ignored in the fictional plot line was also russia’s clear reaction to nato provocations that it would “respond totally asymmetrically” an outcome that could in its worst oucome lead to millions of european deaths. still, no matter the risk of escalation, one which just two weeks ago led to assessment that the “risk of nuclear dirty bomb surges on poor us-russia relations“, nato had to maintain its provocative attitude .all nato had to do was assure that all alliance members would follow the lead, and nobody would stray from the party line.and then everything imploded when none other than the foreign minister of nato member germany, frank-walter steinmeier,criticized nato for having a bellicose policy towards russia, describing it as “warmongering”, the german daily bild reported. and just like that, the entire ficitional narrative of “innocent” nato merely reacting to evil russian provcations has gone up in flames.as afp adds, steinmeier merely highlighted all those things which rational persons have known about for a long time, namely the deployment of nato troops near borders with russia in the military alliance’s baltic and east european member states. however, since it comes from a nato member, suddenly one can’t accuse russian propaganda. in fact, nato has absolutely no planned response to just this contingency.“what we should avoid today is inflaming the situation by warmongering and stomping boots,” steinmeier told bild in an interview to be published sunday.german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier“anyone who thinks you can increase security in the alliance with symbolic parades of tanks near the eastern borders, is mistaken,” germany’s top diplomat added.needless to say, russia bitterly opposes nato’s expansion into its soviet-era satellites and last month said it would create three new divisions in its southwest region to meet what it described as a dangerous military build-up along its borders. this is precisely what nato wants as it would be able to then blame russian effect to nato cause as an irrational move by the kremlin, one to which the kind folks at nato hq would have no choice but to respond in their caring defense of all those innocent people, when in reality it is nato that is desperate to provoke and launch the conflict with russia.and now even its own members admit it!in its latest ridiculous escalation, blamed on russia no less, nato announced on monday that it would deploy four battalions to estonia, latvia, lithuania and poland to counter a more assertive russia, ahead of a landmark summit in warsaw next month. well, as steinmeier made it very clear, nato’s deployment to provoke russia was precisely that. as a result a russian “assymmetric” response is assured, and this time it may even spill over into the combat arena, something which would bring infinite delight to washington’s military-industrial complex neocon puppets.in an interview with bild on thursday, nato chief jens stoltenberg said russia is seeking to create “a zone of influence through military means”. “we are observing massive militarisation at nato borders — in the arctic, in the baltic, from the black sea to the mediterranean sea,” he told the newspaper.credit to

blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!a close look at indian governor mike pence, the man announced as donald trump’s running mate last week, tells us a few things about what counts as “establishment” in today’s republican party.“pence is so far right when it comes to women’s and lgbt issues,” writes joan walsh at the nation, “he makes trump look like a democrat. frankly, he’s a smooth-talking todd akin”—the republican former u.s. representative from missouri who famously tried to limit federal funding for abortion to women who suffered what he called “legitimate rape.”in congress, pence co-sponsored that bill.pence is also the guy who began the gop’s ugly and so far unsuccessful crusade to defund planned parenthood, back in <NUM>. “he’s the only one i know of who has been so completely obsessed with planned parenthood,” planned parenthood president cecile richards said back then. “this just seems to be an enormous focus of his.” of course, pence got more company in the tea party congress of <NUM>, and that year he threatened to shut down the government over continued planned parenthood funding.since becoming governor in <NUM>, pence has signed various anti-abortion bills and succeeded in defunding planned parenthood in his state. that helped lead to a devastating resurgence of hiv/aids, since planned parenthood was one of a few providers of hiv testing in the state.unfortunately, there’s not much daylight between trump and pence on the issue of planned parenthood. although daughter ivanka reportedly got trump to say nice things about the group’s women’s-health work earlier this year, both he and pence have said that if planned parenthood wants to continue providing primary care for women, and crucial screenings for breast and cervical cancers, it should stop providing abortions. …also, trump has promised to punish women for getting abortions (and then flip-flopped); pence has actually done so. in indianapolis, <NUM>-year-old purvi patel was prosecuted for using the pills doctors prescribe for early pregnancy termination allegedly later in her term. her conviction is being appealed.of course, pence is probably best known nationally for supporting one of the nation’s toughest so-called “religious freedom” laws, and then backing down when big businesses from apple to salesforce to angie’s list said they’d curtail commerce in his state. pence says he “fixed” the law, but lgbt advocates don’t entirely buy it. conservatives do, however, and they consider pence a traitor for bowing to business.pence is an odd choice, for many reasons: he’s got low approval ratings in his home state and faces a tough reelection battle. he supports free trade and opposes trump’s muslim ban. the indiana governor endorsed texas senator ted cruz just before the state’s crucial primary in may, but said wishy-washy nice things about trump, too. when trump crushed cruz in indiana, pence got on the trump train.",<DATE>

of stars who have been replaced.one of the most revealing exposes of hollywood. no depravity is too great for hollywood’s illuminati elite who play central role in inducting society into their cabalist satanic cult.“go; behold, i am sending you as sheep among the wolves” luke <NUM>: <NUM>by sasha spencer(henrymakow.com)(from sept <NUM>, <NUM>)we all know that hollywood is perverse but an insider has posted new information that is beyond the pale. it confirms everything i encountered when i flitted along the margins of show business in the <NUM>′s and much more, including human cloning and child sacrifice.film sets are sexually highly charged. my own encounters with show-biz strangeness ran the usual gamut of offers to sleep and play with producers and other power players, group sex and so on.or, upon being cast as the lead in a play, in a fairly large city (which could have really helped me along), i realized that i needed to “live with” and “sleep with” the octogenarian director for the duration of the theater run.i declined the part.or, finding out a cast member’s girlfriend is really a she-male, or a famous country-western singer likes to be used as a human toilet.or, going back stage to meet danny thomas, the star of “make room for daddy” after a performance. he grabbed me and rammed his tongue down my throat.what price to make it in show biz? there are two realities to the industry. first, there are the insider blood line types who, when they get out of film school, a call is made and the career is launched. shirley maclaine and warren beatty might be an an example. many of these people come from multigenerational abuse families. it also helps if you are jewish. i am not.then there are the nobodies who eventually come across the pay to play scenario. basically prostitution, sleeping with producers, directors and so on, and being on call as an escort. if you say no, your career goes nowhere.[according to author darwin porter, many stars including james dean, rock hudson, marilyn monroe and lucille ball, started their careers as prostitutes. hoover & tolson: sexual secrets of america's most famous men and women (<NUM>).]that is why you have never heard of me! the author of the expose and i both shared the moniker of right brain, creative types who were idealistic and naive about the world. it’s what saved us both in the long run.the grooming stagein order to reach the higher echelons of entertainment with no family or tribe connections, you must work yourself up through the drug use/sexual permissiveness/prostitution/escort stages to things like mind control, handlers, and into darker levels of spiritual possession or soul-loss at a profound level.this sets the stage for the performer to become part of a very dark world. artists who resist are a huge threat.so the controllers compromise you in some way with evidence of your perversions, or they threaten you, or they finally kill you.and if you are a big money-maker, you are often replaced, and i don’t mean by another actor. this way, “you” or the <NUM>.<NUM> version of you, can keep on making money for the dark side!we are talking about losing one’s soul people!and… it’s real!you can be clonedcloning has been around for many decades. we just are kept in the dark about it.our former entertainer has many stories to relay of how famous celebrities changed in character and looks. her suspicion is that they had been replaced. she names such stars as, michael jackson, ann margaret, joan baez, jane fonda and jennifer connolly.she had friends in the industry who knew these entertainers personally and believed they had indeed been replaced.she also mentions bob dylan. recently, i saw an interview with dylan who was on <NUM> minutes, and he admitted on camera that he had indeed made a deal with the devil long ago!bob didn’t look happy.replacement can be confusing to detect because many stars have plastic surgery with horrific results. basic mutilation. think mickey rourke or priscilla presley.in their cases, extreme surgeries could be used as a form of torture to “fall in line” or the actor /performer is replaced. the surgery takes place after the cloning to improve the original.clones never live up to the originals. they deteriorate rapidly. there are many subtle differences. however, many actors will do anything to their bodies and minds to work in hollywood. most are damaged people.cautioning us to never idolize any “star”, our insider says all successful actors, stars, celebs and so on, have been heavily compromised in order to achieve their “dream”.i mean, after all, show business is just a distraction. in ancient rome, the poet juvenal describing the political power scene of the day said, “panem et circenses”, bread and circuses”. meaning, if you keep the masses fed and entertained, they are less likely to kill or even notice their invisible handlers.so it all boils down to the elite and the demonic force that is behind them.she spoke of the madonnas who groom the younger women to eventually take their place with the sexual/psychic rituals. she said that all these women are mind controlled and abused.our insider states, many celeb charity boards are fronts for prostitution, sex trafficking and drugs. many celebs are set up with boyfriends and marriages that are arranged. the actresses agree to do porn in exchange for all the perks of being with a rich man but knowing they will lose it all if they break up with the guy.human sacrificesnuff films are just human sacrifices. these films are done when a sex slave/prostitute/call boy, has gotten slightly haggard and past their “sell by” date or has pissed off the wrong people.there is a huge market for these satanic sacrifice films among the exclusive, connected and wealthy circles i.e. the demonic illuminati.she also touches on the pregnant actresses who are suddenly not pregnant. their babies are used for human sacrifice. she claims bristol palin has been pregnant four times and three of the babies disappeared. she was suddenly not pregnant. you can read more about this here.our actress believes there is a long list of famous people who have sacrificed a child, including many political figures.many mysterious accidents have happened to big name people and thereafter, magically, their career takes off.now i know where the saying comes from, whereby in signing a contract, people joke about giving up their first born child! for example, george bush sr., had two little girls that died. ever heard of them?remember barbara bush keeping a fetus in a jar?i can attest to this phenomenon and, i am very suspicious. shortly after my beautiful young mother was killed in a horrific “accident”, weeks after the death, i was invited to washington d.c. by a u.s. senator.my father was his financial campaign manager. i went to the home of george bush, sr. for a party. holding poppy’s hand and chatting with barbara, i remember being in total and complete shock and profoundly disassociated from my body at the time and for years afterward.soon after this presidential visit, my father’s career took off like gangbusters and we soon had oodles of money and a family jet. and who was flying in that jet? henry kissinger among many other elites. pretty suspicious if you ask me.a sacrifice?i don’t know. but, it makes me want to go hmm… mm…mm…mammon?kansas no moreour informant ran into the dark arts very early on. these dark arts are ruled by the illuminati/reptilian/negative et’s, negative humans/military industrial complex.the negative gatekeepers need a certain number of true artists, light worker types as camouflage. sometimes these light types are targeted to move to a higher level on the playing field.at the same time they are surrounded by relatively nice “handlers” who don’t corrupt them. but, the conclusion is that at some point everyone in the industry has to make the decision to yield to the corruption or get out.that is, if it’s not too late. we are human batteries to them. they pilfer our higher energy.drugs, alcohol and spiritual possession make it a much easier choice for the actor/performer to compromise, i’ll do anything to get a job.that is when the evil really steps in. many of these people keep drugging and drinking to make their harrowing dark choice “ok”.but, many cannot keep up the illusion and want out at some point.if they protest or tell the truth of what is really going on…they are often replaced. they become surrounded by dark people, dark organizations and dark non-humans (et’s or hybrids). once this happens they barely have control over what happens next.many victims of this satanic industry are those who have no family ties to speak of. their lives are easier to erase and dispose of. all planned, all by design.conclusion:we, the people, especially in the west, have allowed hollywood hype to distort our sense of reality. none of this is by accident. all has been carefully planned.our world is held hostage by an illusion run by a satanic cult.the classic faustian deal with the devil is real. see this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deal_with_the_devil. this contract made by many in the entertainment industry, allows something horrible to possess the individual spiritually, physically, emotionally and sexually. one’s entire being is consumed by dark energy and personal free will is extinguished. many artists take the deal. i don’t think it ever works out well for any of them; as there is no honor among thieves.see this:http://youtu.be/cibgzavyetm.our insider-actress says, she was saved by her light. she intrinsically knew who to stay away from. i positively know that my own light and inner knowing kept me safe.all of us, citizens of this <NUM>d, earthly plane, those who are rightfully meant to be here, we all need to stop being complicit in our own destruction!. we can do that by continuing to wake up.we need to grasp the fundamentals of this reality! just say no to the false illusion.we are being preyed upon by a preternatural force that deals in the grandest of illusions and pushes forth, the great work of the ages. look it up.our only hope to escape this evil/dark reality is to shed the reptilian scales from our eyes, disengage from the lie and stop feeding the beast.–related:speaking of possessed people…check out this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypdf<NUM>q<NUM>nbo&feature=player_embedded. i’d say sarah jessica is looking a bit reptilian don’t you think?

blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!sorry for the belated post! we spent the holidays doing fun family things, including going to the movies. this review is about the highlight of our movie-going: star wars: the force awakens, otherwise known as episode vii. i’m assuming that everyone who wants to see it has, so i’ll let the spoilers fly.i have to say that when the movie opens and the “star wars” banner starts to scroll, i got a little choked up. for those of us of a certain age, star wars was the background of our childhood/tweendom. we were told there would be nine movies, three that preceded the original trilogy, and three that followed. as adults, we heard that the three prequels would come first. (i was a little saddened. i wasn’t as interested in how anakin fell as how han and leia got married.) then the prequels were. . well. . .awful. so, the news that in our middle age, the last three would be made was met with excitement mixed with a lot of anxiety. would these be awful, too? would they be all ewoks and jar jar? would the acting be so bad as to make you laugh in inappropriate parts? so, with some trepidation, a generation of viewers bought tickets ahead of time to see episode vii.and it was good. maybe great, maybe amazing, but definitely all was good. at the end there was clapping and rejoicing, for the story but also for the sense that the movie makers (disney now, not george lucas) heard the fans. understood what was so genre-defining and game-changing about episode iii. gave the fans the story, without muppets and bad actors. if the original movie resonated with the audience’s priors about good and evil, the latest installment resonates with the audience’s need to be understood and heard. george lucas has criticized the “retro” episode vii for pandering to the fans. whatever. i loved it. i walked out and wanted to walk right back in again.if you’ve seen the movie, then you can track episode vii and episode iii and have already realized they are the same (awesome) movie. there is a bad guy, who used to be a good guy (kylo ren), and a bad guy mentor (supreme leader snoke), who are trying to take over the galaxy under the name the first order. there is a resistance leader who has secret information (poe) who gives it to a droid (bb-<NUM>) to deliver it to the resistance. there are two young people who bump into bb-<NUM>′s mission (rey and finn) and each have their own reasons for following or wanting to leave. both rey and finn have parts of luke and han solo. rey is a scavenger and a tinkerer and a pilot (like han), but she obviously has a higher calling to the force (like luke). finn is moved by love (like luke), but also has self-preservation tendencies (like han). but they are interesting in their own right. finn is fn-<NUM>, a stormtrooper. these iconic troops that have been nameless and faceless to star wars fans now have a backstory. finn was taken from his family by the first order and programmed to fight. (his programming seems to not have taken at all!) after his first battle, finn decides to escape but needs a pilot to help him. luckily for him, poe is being held prisoner and is the best pilot in the resistance. together, they escape, heading toward jakku, to find bb-<NUM> and take the secret information back to the resistance. after their ship is disabled, finn wakes up on jakku, where he meets up with rey, who has befriended bb-<NUM>. after stormtroopers come calling, the three take off in the millennium falcon (!!) to get the information to the resistance. guess what the information is? a map to where luke skywalker has been living in self-imposed exile!!so, the story is set and the parallels to the original lead one to predict where the plot is going to go. characters are related to one another, someone dies in a way that inspires the newest jedi, etc. along the way we meet back up with han and chewbacca, and even general (nee princess) leia. there are many, many moments of homage to the original, and i ate them up with the rest of the audience.there are lots of things to criticize, of course. the galaxy, which has as many non-humanoid beings as humanoid beings, seems to be about <NUM>% female and .<NUM>% nonwhite. droids may be more slave than robot. (we rewatched the original three, and even in those movies, droids inconsistently feel pain, fear torture or destruction, and have feelings.) as many people have pointed out, the best parts of the movie are unoriginal. but i will watch it again and again. rey is a much more interesting female character than princess leia, and a less whiny jedi than luke. (don’t get me started about hayden christensen’s anakin. anakin is such a bad jedi, he makes finn look like a great stormtrooper.) finn seems also more three-dimensional than han. i’m very interested to see where the plot is going.where is the plot going? one of the star wars trailers has a voice-over by luke (mark hamill), saying “the force is strong in my family. my father has it. i have it. my sister has it. and you have it.” this is a riff on the same speech luke gives leia in episode vi, but with the last sentence added. this speech is never given in episode vii (in fact luke doesn’t speak in this episode). so, we assume that he will eventually give the speech to rey, but how does rey have the force? is she related to luke? will the movies ever mention midichlorians again (no!). to be continued. . . .",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,family film blogging (special edition): star wars: the force awakens,the conglomerate,,[''],,,<NUM>,<NUM>,beforeitsnews.com,fake,http://beforeitsnews.com/business/<NUM>/<NUM>/cnnmoney-lays-off-biz-reporter-in-washington-<NUM>.html,"cnnmoney lays off biz reporter in washington% of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents.headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump!

management of risks in the financial markets is making for a difficult situation to reconcile. a credit crunch era is upon us, a contracting of the money supply. rising costs of living and a dry-up of

possible outcome, as dark as it is.people have been engineered for a fall, and it is only a matter of time before things go south.the forecast remains dark because of the looming, apocalyptic factors that have driven up a phony stock market surge that is really a devastating bubble waiting to burst into total disaster.greg hunter of usa watchdog speaks with financial markets expert karl denninger,

that’s very, very dangerous because at the point the margin calls start, the cascade is almost impossible to stop. you’ve got imbalances throughout the system. you’ve got the federal reserve where it

them. ask the coal industry – obama’s administration is unilaterally regulating it out of existence. and on, and on, and…but president obama doesn’t have to specifically dislike you. he need only prefer your regulatory opponent – and at their behest he will make your life really, really miserable. to wit: the tech sector.the administration’s federal communications commission (fcc) in february – via title ii reclassification and network neutrality – unilaterally declared itself the pernicious overlord of all internet service providers (isps). is it because he dislikes the likes of comcast

we were (and remain) opposed to obamacare – the president gave it to us anyway.so we the people started electing republican congressional majorities – to demonstrate and embody our opposition. what was the crony administration to do? it simply stopped using congress. and started unilaterally issuing executive fiats to impose things we didn’t like – but the cronies did. like net neutrality – for google.but the title ii reclassification is a huge power grab. it gives the obama administration sudden (highly dubious) uber-authority over the entire internet – not just isps. which means the likes of google also fall under its monstrous thumb – if it chooses to press down its digit. does the crony administration do so? of course not.fcc unequivocal in declaring no intent to regulate edge providersin case you were unsure – google is an “edge provider.”google, facebook ‘do not track’ requests? fcc says they can keep ignoring themno one – no one – tracks you like google. tracking you – and then selling you and what you do online – is just about their entire trillion-dollar-business-model. the crony administration certainly wouldn’t put a stop to that.what happens when government

that i wrote, i wrote on november <NUM>th. the book, on tyranny, was done by christmas. which means if people read it now, and people are reading it, and it's describing the world they are in, that means i’ve successfully made predictions based on history. we’re going to talk about what is going to come, but i want to point out that timeline—it was basically completely blind. but the book does describe what is going on now.the year figure is there because we have to recognize that things move fast. nazi germany took about a year. hungary took about two and a half years. poland got rid of the top-level judiciary within a year. it’s a rough historical guess, but the point is because there is an outside limit, you therefore have to act now. you have to get started early. it’s just very practical advice. it’s the meta-advice of the past: that things slip out of reach for you, psychologically very quickly, and then legally almost as quickly. it’s hard for people to act when they feel other people won’t act. it’s hard for people to act when they feel like they have to break the law to do so. so it is important to get out in front before people face those psychological and legal barriers.am i more worried now? i realize that was your question. no, i’m exactly as worried as i was before, in november. i think that the people who inhabit the white house inhabit a different ideological world in which they would like for the united states not to be the constitutional system that it now is. i was concerned about that in november. i’m concerned about it now. nothing that has happened since has changed the way i see things.sr: let’s talk about how this evolution takes place. you’ve written about how 'post-truth is pre-fascism.' you talk about leaders ignoring facts, law and history. how far along this progression are we? i’m wondering where you might see things going next.ts: that’s tough because what history does is give you a whole bunch of cases where democratic republics become authoritarian regimes; sometimes fascist regimes, sometimes communist regimes. it doesn’t give you one storyline: a, b, c, d. it gives you a bunch of clusters of a, and a bunch of clusters of c. but factuality is really important and more important than people realize, because it’s the substructure of regime change.we think about democracy, and that’s the word that americans love to use, democracy, and that’s how we characterize our system. but if democracy just means going to vote, it’s pretty meaningless. russia has democracy in that sense. most authoritarian regimes have democracy in that sense. nazi germany had democracy in that sense, even after the system had fundamentally changed.democracy only has substance if there’s the rule of law. that is, if people believe that the votes are going to be counted and they are counted. if they believe that there’s a judiciary out there that will make sense of things if there’s some challenge. if there isn’t rule of law, people will be afraid to vote the way they want to vote. they'll vote for their own safety as opposed to their convictions. so the thing we call democracy depends on the rule of law. and the things we call the rule of law depends upon trust. law functions <NUM> percent of the time automatically. it functions because we think it’s out there. and that, in turn, depends on the sense of truth. so there’s a mechanism here. you can get right to heart of the matter if you can convince people that there is no truth. which is why the stuff that we characterize as post-modern and might dismiss is actually really, really essential.the second thing about 'post-truth is pre-fascism' is i’m trying to get people’s attention, because that is actually how fascism works. fascism says, disregard the evidence of your senses, disregard observation, embolden deeds that can’t be proven, don’t have faith in god but have faith in leaders, take part in collective myth of an organic national unity, and so forth. fascism was precisely about setting the whole enlightenment aside and then selling what sort of myths emerged. now those [national] myths are pretty unpredictable, and contingent on different nations and different leaders and so on, but to just set facts aside is actually the fastest catalyst. so that part concerns me a lot.where we’re going? the classic thing to watch out for is the shift from one governing strategy to another. in the u.s. system, the typical governing strategy is you more or less have to follow your constituents with legislation because of the election cycle. that’s one pulse of politics. the other pulse of politics is emergency. there’s some kind of terrorist attack and then the leader tries to suspend basic constitutional rights. and then we get on a different rhythm, where the rhythm is not one electoral cycle to the next but one emergency to the next. that’s how regime changes take place. it’s a classic way since the reichstag fire [when the nazis burned their nation’s capitol building and blamed communist arsonists].so in terms of what might happen next, or what people could look out for, some kind of event that the government claims is a terrorist incident, would be something to be prepared for. that’s why it’s one of the lessons in the book.sr: you have talked before about that kind of emergency justification—and even with vladimir putin in russia. is that what you think would happen here? because with the exception of the judiciary, a lot of american institutions, like congress, are not really resisting. they’re going along.ts: they’re going along… but my own intuition would be the emergency situation arises because going along isn’t going to be enough. paradoxically, congress is going along and is going to pass a bunch of stuff, which is not actually very popular. right? it’s not going to be so popular to have millions of people lose health insurance, which is what’s going to happen. the ironic things about the republican congress is now it has the ability to do everything it wants to do, but none of what it wants to do is that popular. except with the few big lobbies, of course. the freedom the republicans have is the freedom to impose their agenda on down.the same thing goes with mr. trump. the things that he might do that some people would like, like building a wall or driving all the immigrants out, those things are going to be difficult or slow. in the case of the wall, i personally don’t believe it will ever happen. it’s going to be very slow. so my suspicion is that it is much easier to have a dramatic negative event, than have a dramatic positive event. that is one of the reasons i am concerned about the reichstag fire scenario. the other reason is that we are being mentally prepared for it by all the talk about terrorism and by the muslim ban. very often when leaders repeat things over and over they are preparing you for when that meme actually emerges in reality.sr: i want to change the topic slightly. you cite many examples from germany in <NUM>, the year hitler consolidated power. so what did ordinary germans miss that’s relevant for ordinary americans now? i know some of this is the blurring of facts. but when i have talked to holocaust survivors, they often say, nobody ever thought things would be that bad, or nobody thought the germans would go as far as they did.ts: the german jews then, and people now, don’t understand how quick their neighbors will change; don’t understand how quickly society can change. they don’t understand the fact that a life that’s been predictable for a long time, doesn’t mean that it will be predictable tomorrow. and people like to think that their experience is exceptional. german jews might have thought, 'well, there were pogroms [ethnic cleansing] in russia, but surely nothing like that could happen here.' that’s what many german jews thought. so one issue is people need to realize how quickly things can change.the second thing that german jews were not aware of, or germans were not aware of, was how new media can quickly change conversations. in that way, it’s not exactly the same, but radio at that time often ended up being a channel for propaganda. there are parallels with the internet now, where there were hopes that it would be [primarily] enlightening. but in fact, it turns out that with presidential tweets, or with bots, or isolated habits of viewing, it isn’t necessarily enlightening. it’s the opposite. a lot of us were blindsided by the internet in much the same way that people could be blindsided by radio in the <NUM>s.but here’s the other view. the one that we have that german jews didn’t have in <NUM> is we have their experience. that’s the premise of the whole book; the premise is that the <NUM>th century showed us what can happen, and there’s lots of wonderful scholarship by german historians and others, which breaks down what can happen and how. and so, one of the first things that we should be doing is taking advantage of the one opportunity that we really have that they didn’t, which is to learn from that history. and that’s the premise of the book.sr: all of your book’s lessons are very personal: don’t obey in advance. believe in truth. stand out. defend institutions. be calm but as courageous as you can be. yet the change or oppression that you are talking about is systemic and institutional. what do you say to people who say, 'i’ll try, but i may not have the power here.' there’s that cliche, tilting at windmills. ...ts: well, if everyone tilted against a windmill, the windmill would fall down, right? party of the tragedy of don quixote is he’s tilting against the wrong thing. so that’s not our problem. we’re pretty sure what the problem is. but he was also alone except for his faithful companion. we’re not really alone. there are millions and millions of people who are looking for that thing to do. just by sheer math, if everyone does a little thing, it will make a difference. and much of what i am recommending is—you’re right, they are things that people can do, but they also involve some kind of engagement. whether it’s the small talk [with those you disagree with] or whether it’s the corporeal politics. and that little bit of engagement helps you realize that what you are doing has a kind of sense, even if it doesn’t immediately change the order.and finally, a lot of the political theory that i am calling upon, which comes from the anti-nazis and the anti-communists, makes the point that even though you don’t realize it, your own example matters a whole lot, whether it’s positively or negatively. there are times, and this is one of those times, where small gestures, or their absence, can make a huge difference. so the things that might not have mattered a year ago do matter now. the basic thing is we are making a difference whether we realize it or not, and the basic question is whether it is positive or negative.let me put it a different way. except for really dramatic moments, most of the time authoritarianism depends on some kind of cycle involving a popular consent of some form. it really does matter how we behave. the danger is [if] we say, 'well, we don’t see how it matters, and so therefore we are going to just table the whole question.' if we do that, then we start to slide along and start doing the things that the authorities expect of us. which is why lesson number one is: don’t obey in advance. you have to set the table differently. you have to say, 'this is a situation in which i need to think for myself about all of the things that i am going to do and not just punt. not just wait. nor just see how things seems to me. because if you do that, then you change and you actually become part of the regime change toward authoritarianism.'sr: you cite in the book something i read in high school: eugene ionesco’s existential play about fascism, rhinoceros, where people talk about their colleagues at work, in academia, saying stuff like, 'come on, i don’t agree with everything, but give him a chance.' ionesco’s point is that people join an unthinking herd before they know it.what would you suggest people do, when they run into others who fall on this spectrum?ts: there are a few questions here. one is how to keep yourself going. another is how to energize other people who agree with you. and the third thing is not quite rhinoceros stuff, but how to catch people who are slipping. like that cnn coverage last week of the speech to congress, where one of the cnn commentators said, 'oh, now this is presidential.' that was a rhinoceros moment, because there was nothing presidential—it was atrocious to parade the victims of crimes committed by one ethnicity. that was atrocious and there’s nothing presidential about it.catching rhinoceros moments is one thing. i think it’s really important to think about. the example that ionesco gives is people saying, 'yeah, on one hand, with the jews, maybe they are right.' with trump, people will say something like, 'yeah, but on taxes, maybe he’s right.' and the thing to catch is, 'yeah, but are you in favor of regime change? are you in favor of the end of the american way of democracy and fair play?' because that’s what’s really at stake.with people all the way over at the end of the spectrum who are now confident about trump—that’s a different subject. i think it’s important to maintain impossible human relations across that divide, because some of those people are going to change their minds. it’s harsh. but some will change their minds, and if they have no one to talk to, it will be much harder for them to change their minds. at different points on the spectrum, you have to think in different ways. my own major concern right now is with self-confidence and the energy of the people who do have the deep—and, i think incorrect—conviction that something has gone wildly wrong.sr: the people who have the conviction that something has gone wildly wrong—that can describe trump supporters and trump opponents.ts: that’s a good point. so much of this is personal. in the book, i don’t actually mention anybody’s name, except the thinkers who i admire. so much of this is personal that people think, 'well, if you say anything critical, it is about you as a person, and how you don’t like anything about someone who likes trump.' that’s a way for there to be no political discussion.i think it’s useful, even though you will never win the argument, when you are talking about people who support to the administration, to stay at the level of the constitution. to stay at the level of freedom, or stay at the level of basic issues, like, is global warming really going to be so great, when the entire pentagon says that it is a national security threat? or, is it really such a good idea to treat muslims like this? or, is it really going to be so good when millions of people lose health insurance?keep it at the level of issues as much as possible, because what i’ve found is the pattern that people shift to is, 'why are you going to be so hard on this guy? give him a chance.' but the issues of what’s constitutional, what is actually american, and what’s going to be a policy that they are going to be proud of a year from now—keep the conversation closest to the constitution. it’s easiest to be dismissed when it’s personal. and fundamentally, this is the trick. it isn’t personal. it doesn’t matter who’s in charge. what matters is the system, which people of very different convictions take for granted, is now under threat.sr: you have said that the muslims are being targeted as the jews were targeted in germany. but out here in california, it also feels like the deportation machinery is getting ready for undocumented immigrants. on monday, reuters reported that homeland security officials said they might separate mothers from kids when making arrests. germany did that as it rounded up jews. don’t they face just as grave a threat?ts: with the muslims, the resemblance to anti-semitic policy in germany in ’<NUM> is that if you can pick some group and make them stand in for some international threat, then you can change domestic politics, because domestic politics then is no longer about compromises and competing interests, domestic politics is about who inside the society should actually be seen and outside the society. once you get the wedge in with the first group, them you essentially win. it could be the muslims. it could be somebody else, is the point. the political logic is basically the same.with undocumented immigrants, i think the logic might be a little bit different. i think the goal might be to get us used to seeing a certain kind of police power. and getting us used to seeing things happening to people in public. and then if we get used to that, then we might be more willing for the dial to turn a little bit further. it’s too soon for me to speculate confidently about all of this.i think you’re right though, it could be the muslims, but it doesn’t have to be the muslims. the crucial thing is to get some kind of in [political opening] where people go along with or accept stigmatization. and the logic is there’s always some kind of threat that comes from beyond the country. and that we can fix that threat on a group of people inside the country. and if you go along with this, what else are you agreeing to go along with?sr: to go back to your book, what you’re saying is that people should be vigilant, should know their values and participate at some level with making those values known, because that is what ordinary people can do.ts: yes. the point of the book is [that] we are facing a real crisis and a real moment of choice. the possibilities are much darker than americans are used to considering. but at the same time, what we can do is much more important than we realize. the regime will only change if the gamble of the people in the white house is right: that many of us despise many others of us and that most of us are indifferent. if it turns out that there are emotions and values that are more numerous and more vibrant than indifference and hatred, things are going to be okay. that depends on us. that depends on us making certain realizations. it depends on us acting fast. in that sense it’s a test, not just collectively. maybe there’s no such thing as a collective test. but it is a test for us individually.most americans who haven’t been abroad haven't been faced by something like this. and hopefully they won’t be faced with it again. but we are faced with it as citizens and as individuals. and i think, five or <NUM> years from now, no matter how things turn out, we’ll ask ourselves—or our children will ask us—how we behaved in <NUM>.",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE>

people to reach for man-made medicine as soon as they have a complaint about something. this medicine may be effective for that particular issue, but it may cause other problems down the line. the user might even get addicted to it, and not be able to stop taking it. this is why it is important to solve medical problems as naturally as possible. the same is true if you suffer from herniated discs in your back. read on to find out some tips about the best way to relieve this pain naturally!what are herniated discs?when the vertebrae in your back are being cushioned by the surrounding spongy discs, it means that everything is functioning normally. these discs act as a shock absorber, and keep the vertebrae safe. however, they might become damaged, and therefore result in a herniated disc. this can be caused by advancing age or by injury to the spine. the person will start to experience pain or numbness in the area where the nerve is exposed. this is why it is important to always protect your back when you are engaging in risky activities. a herniated disc can be prevented from getting worse by adjusting a few lifestyle habits.what is the best way to alleviate pain?the best way to alleviate pain from a herniated disc is to purchase a proper mattress. there are thousands of different mattresses to choose from, but you need to get one that is specific to your issue. hybrid mattresses are a good option to look at because they combine different variations of coil, foam, and other materials. the combination may be what it takes to find the perfect bed for you and your back. memory foam could also be a good choice, because it offers a variety of benefits to the user.memory foam mattressesif you lie on a memory foam mattress, the material will conform to your specific body type. you shape will be moulded onto the foam, and it will remain this way after you get up. this is a benefit to you because the foam is alleviating pressure from certain points in your body. it is spreading out the weight of your body so that the pressure points are dispersed. this reduces the amount of back pain you will feel, because it is not being pushed down on as you sleep. memory foam has been known to improve the quality of sleep for people with back pain. they will not be woken up as often during the night, because they are not feeling sudden jolts of pain through their bodies. some people do not go with memory foam mattresses because they feel as though there is not enough support for their backs. the best mattress for you will depend on your own specific needs.proper postureanother way to reduce the pain you feel from herniated discs is to improve your posture. if you are not sure how to go about this, you can seek advice from a chiropractor. otherwise, doing some quick research via the internet is a good way to get you started. there are some products that you can look into as a way of improving your posture. back braces are helpful because they will correct your posture while you wear them. you might think that they are a bit uncomfortable, but they are designed to help you. the brace is basically telling your brain how you are supposed to be holding yourself. they also work to rebuild the muscle tone in your abdomen, torso and core muscles. after a short time of wearing the brace, you will be able to maintain a good posture almost automatically.conclusionherniated discs are not a fun problem to have, but you do have the ability to reduce the amount of pain you feel. by implementing some of these tips, you might even be able to prevent herniated discs from occurring at all! by being aware of your physical health, you can stop problems such as these from occurring before they do. using the proper mattress for sleep,

europe shaking on its foundations: “only alternative to eu is war”headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!this article was written by tyler durden and originally published at zero hedge.editor’s comment: the eu is now asserting its authority as an instrument of stability, and telling member states to fall in line, lest more severe consequences should arise – namely war. does this amount to a threat, or do eu bureaucrats merely mean to indicate that only through a centralized authority with diminished states rights can they avoid war? europe may face disintegration anyway; its currency crises and migration woes are causing instability, and its caught-in-the-middle position complicates its relationships with the east and west.nevertheless, the drums of war are beating all across the globe, and influence over europe and the middle east have become region blocs for conquest. the original formations of the eu were built through an atlantic network, including the secretive bilderberg group, as an extension of the post-war pax americana.eu commissioner’s dire warning: “the only alternative to europe is war”by tyler durdenwhile the saying goes “good fences make good neighbors,” it appears the leadership of the eu is starting to get frustrated with the lack of acquiescence among some of the ‘union’s’ newer or more marginal members. in a somewhat stunning statement, following ongoing and contentious meetings to discuss solutions to the migrant ‘problem’, eu commissioner timmermanns appeared to warn disagreeable member states, “there is an alternative to everything. i believe in eu cooperation because of all other forms in history have been tried to help europeans get on better, and with the exception of this one, all other forms have led to war – so let’s stick to this one.”as elsevier reports (via google translate),european leaders read the last few days the alarm about the survival of the european union (eu). prague said commissioner frans timmermans (pvda) friday that the eu is only one alternative: war. “the only alternative to the eu is war,” said timmermans friday gave a speech at a conference in prague, said a reporter for the times of london who attended the speech. timmermans is the way europe responds to the migration crisis’ the biggest threat to the eu ever. the commissioner underlined that countries should cooperate better when it comes to border controls. “migration is part of life, but we must lead these movements together in the right direction,” said timmermans. matching words timmermans in the alarmist tone that european leaders were heard in recent days about the survival of the eu. earlier this week, timmermans at the house of europe lecture in amsterdam that he fears for the survival of the eu. “i do not optimistic about doing that, because i’m just not. this is the first time in my conscious experience of european cooperation that i think: it could ever really be able beaches. luxembourg foreign minister, who will chair the council of the european union on behalf of his country, spoke in an interview about identical words. the current migration crisis is the european ideal of free movement shaking on its foundations. eu president donald tusk said that the eu is engaged in “a race against the clock.” “but we are determined to win this race,” said tusk. “as i warned earlier, the only way not to dismantle the schengen ensure proper management of the external borders of the eu.” the eu appears to be unable to curb migration flows. because the borders are not guarded, seeing more and more countries are forced to protect their own borders. even the welcoming sweden went on thursday to intensive checks on the southern border.remember when hank paulson waved the “mutual assured destruction” card in the face of the u.s. with his infamous “blank check” three page term sheet? now, it’s europe’s turn.what’s worse, however, for things to devolve this much, it confirms that the european ‘union’ is rapidly disintegrating, much more than the recent surge in barbed wire fences around european nations will demonstrate, and as timmermanns warns, that means war.this article has been contributed by shtf plan. visit www.shtfplan.com for alternative news, commentary and preparedness info.source:

just the beginning… again: “this kind of carnage can happen all over europe”headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!this article was originally published by michael snyder at his economic collapse blog.editor’s note: it was always just a matter of time, since the whole european fiasco was merely patched over after the last round. all the new powers given to the european banks (and all the king’s horses and men) couldn’t put it back together again, and couldn’t stop what was inevitable under the existing conditions – greece has been a ticking time bomb and things closer to disaster than ever.everyone already knows how bad things stand to become if it plays out at its worst, so get ready. a grexit may be in the near future, a brexit is still very possible, and another round of global financial titanic could be in the works. time will tell…the next great european financial crisis has begunthe greek financial system is in the process of totally imploding, and the rest of europe will soon follow. neither the greeks nor the germans are willing to give in, and that means that there is very little chance that a debt deal is going to happen by the end of june. so that means that we will likely see a major greek debt default and potentially even a greek exit from the eurozone. at this point, credit default swaps on greek debt have risen <NUM> percent in price since the beginning of this year, and the market has priced in a <NUM> percent chance that a greek debt default will happen. over the past month, the yield on two year greek bonds has skyrocketed from <NUM> percent to more than <NUM> percent, and the greek stock market has fallen by a total of <NUM> percent during the last three trading days alone. this is what a financial collapse looks like, and if greece does leave the euro, we are going to see this kind of carnage happen all over europe.officials over in europe are now openly speaking of the need to prepare for a “state of emergency” now that negotiations have totally collapsed. at one time, it would have been unthinkable for greece to leave the euro, but now it appears that this is precisely what will happen unless a miracle happens…greece is heading for a state of emergency and an exit from the euro following the collapse of talks to agree a bailout deal, senior eu officials warned last night. europe must be prepared to step in otherwise greek society would face an unprecedented crisis with power blackouts, medicine shortages and no money to pay for police, they said.in the past, the greeks have always buckled under pressure. but this new greek government was elected with a mandate to end austerity, and so far they have shown a remarkable amount of resolve. in order for a debt deal to happen, one side is going to have to blink, and at this point it does not look like it will be the greeks…the world’s financial markets are facing up to the possibility that greece could soon become the first country to crash out of europe’s single currency. talks between athens and its eurozone creditors have collapsed in acrimony just days before a final deadline for greece to unlock the €<NUM>.<NUM>bn (£<NUM>.<NUM>bn) in bailout funds it needs to avoid a catastrophic debt default. the greek prime minister, alexis tsipras, accused the creditor powers of hidden “political motives” in their demands that greece make further cuts to public pension payments in return for the financial aid. “we are shouldering the dignity of our people, as well as the hopes of the people of europe,” mr tsipras said in a defiant statement. “we cannot ignore this responsibility. this is not a matter of ideological stubbornness. this is about democracy.”as we approach the point of no return, both sides are preparing for the endgame.in greece, members of parliament have been studying what happened in iceland a few years ago. many of them believe that a greek debt default combined with a nationalization of greek banks and a greek exit from the euro could set the nation back on the path to prosperity fairly rapidly. the following comes from the telegraph…the radical wing of greece’s syriza party is to table plans over coming days for an icelandic-style default and a nationalisation of the greek banking system, deeming it pointless to continue talks with europe’s creditor powers. syriza sources say measures being drafted include capital controls and the establishment of a sovereign central bank able to stand behind a new financial system. while some form of dual currency might be possible in theory, such a structure would be incompatible with euro membership and would imply a rapid return to the drachma. the confidential plans were circulating over the weekend and have the backing of <NUM> mps from the aristeri platforma or ‘left platform’, as well as other hard-line groupings in syriza’s spectrum. it is understood that the nationalist anel party in the ruling coalition is also willing to force a rupture with creditors, if need be.meanwhile, in a desperate attempt to get the greeks to give in at the last moment, greek’s creditors are preparing to pull out all the stops in order to put as much financial pressure on greece as possible…germany’s suddeutsche zeitung reported that the creditors are drawing an ultimatum to the greeks, threatening to cut off greek access to the european payments system and forcing capital controls on the country as soon as this weekend. the plan would lead to the temporary closure of the banks, followed by a rationing of cash withdrawals.for a long time, most in the financial world assumed that a debt deal would eventually happen. but now reality is setting in. as i mentioned at the top of this article, the cost to insure greek debt has risen by an astounding <NUM> percent since the beginning of this year…given these dramatic stakes, the risk of a greek default has gone way up. one way to measure that risk is by looking at the skyrocketing price of insurance policies that would pay out if greek bonds go bust. the cost to insure greek debt for one year against the risk of default has skyrocketed <NUM>% since the start of the <NUM>, according to factset data. these insurance-like contracts, known as credit default swaps, imply there is a <NUM>% to <NUM>% probability of greece defaulting on its debt, according to jigar patel, a credit strategist at barclays. the probability of a greek default soars to a whopping <NUM>% for five-year cds, patel said. “default is looking more and more likely,” peter

were wrong. a recent report led by theand the center for public integrity, has revealed that the manufacturers of opioid drugs, such as oxycontin, vicodin and fentanyl, spent a whopping $<NUM> million on campaign contributions and lobbying efforts. this huge amount of money was spent pushing against state efforts to restrict the amount of prescription opioid drugs floating around.for the unaware, the united states is currently experiencing an opioid epidemic – one that has been particularly profitable for big pharma. oxycontin has been one of the most prolific drugs in the prescription opioid craze, and one of the most addictive.writes that a recent expose by theuncovered the fact that purdue pharma knowingly lied about their product. despite being marketed as a <NUM>-hour pill, the' handiwork revealed that purdue ""knew the claim was a lie, as did its sales reps, patients, medical professional and even regulatory authorities. at best, oxy only provided eight hours of pain relief ...""this means that patients were exposed to withdrawal symptoms, received inadequate care, and were often pushed up to a higher dose of oxycontin – which puts patients at increased risk of death. however, higher dosages make more money than more frequent doses, so this was a very clever, and malevolent , marketing choice by purdue.you can see where this is the kind of company that caresabout public well-being, and quite a lot about profits. it is not surprising that purdue pharma, and others like them, have spent nearly a billion dollars trying to protect their hold on the american people. between <NUM> and <NUM>, big pharma spent nearly <NUM> times more fighting opioid restrictions than opioid restriction advocates spent in the same time period. sadly, it is not just big pharma pushing their agenda. even organizations that many people consider to be ""respectable,"" have dipped their toes in the pond. the american cancer society, for example, has reportedly teamed up with the pharmaceutical industry.opioids are very similar to heroin, only they can be prescribed to patients as pain relievers. due to their highly addictive nature, it is no surprise that the industry desperately wants to protect their ability to be prescribed to anyone for just about anything; opioids are a cash cow.dr. andrew kolodny, a tremendous supporter of prescription opioid reform, told the: ""they are reaping enormous profits from aggressive prescribing."" and while they benefit, millions suffer.over <NUM> million americans reportedly suffer with an addiction to opioid drugs. just shy of a half-million people suffer with heroin addiction, as well. the national institute on drug abuse reports that roughly <NUM> percent of all heroin users report that their addiction began with misusing opioid drugs . being that prescription opioids are rather expensive, it is no surprise that people eventually move on to less expensive options. this figure shows that it is not just people currently using prescription opioids that are being harmed by these drugs, but many others as well. one could even postulate that a significant portion of heroin overdoses could be traced back to opioids, in addition to the thousands of deaths caused by opioids directly. some estimates indicate that opioids are related to up to <NUM> deaths each day spending $<NUM> million on protecting their profits instead of supporting legislation that would help to end the opioid epidemic ensured that their priorities would be easily understood. despite the claims of big pharma companies like purdue that they actually care about addiction and the people affected by it, it has becomeclear that thethey care about is the fact that it makes them money.",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE>

passing feeling or a state of being for you?tons of articles (and books) have been written about how to be happy, and there is some good information out there. i have read and synthesised hundreds of hours of research and experiments here for you, in this action-driven article.what you will find is some deep, life-changing stuff.if you think that all talk about “how to be happy” is fluffy material and common sense, you are in it for a change.there is a theory in psychology called the hedonic treadmill, which says that great events (like winning a lottery) and terrible events (like losing a leg) can happen in your life, but after a while you are always back to your “baseline happiness”. if that is true, then more important than trying to change your external life is to actually improve your baseline happiness. this is the focus of this article – and not “feel happy” strategies.each item here is concluded with a suggested action step. and at the end of the post you will find a link to download a pdf with all of them ?understanding what authentic happiness isis happiness a feeling or a state of being? what is its nature, and what are its causes?wikipedia defines happiness as “a mental or emotional state of well-being characterized by positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy”. there can never be, any objective measurement of happiness based on external achievements. it is an interpretation of reality, and not a result of reality.actually, happiness is such a loaded term, that i wonder if it is the right one for what we are truly seeking. i personally prefer to speak of fulfillment, contentment, and well-being. the greeks, on the other hand, spoke of eudamonia, the “well-lived life”the problem seems to be understanding what causes human beings to continually experience this state. my research and self-experiments have led me to believe (that) there are three “kinds” of happiness: personal, transpersonal, (and) transcendental.personal happiness. most people live by the belief that happiness is simply the result of accumulating as many pleasurable moments as possible, and of fulfilling one’s desires. money, possessions, food, fun, sex, fame, power. here is both the trap of “living as if there is no tomorrow” (the hedonistic blind focus in the present) and “living in hope of a better tomorrow” (putting off happiness to the achievement of a future goal).the problem with this is that the pursuit of these pleasures and achievements can often be a painful and frustrating process (that is, an unhappy process). besides, the happy-feeling resulting from these achievements is short-lived and usually less glorious than the promise (see havard psychologist daniel gilbert on “miswanting” ). on top of that, in many cases we must fight hard to keep what was gained. finally, even if we are those rare beings that can always easily get and keep what we want, without much pain associate(d) with it, the inevitable result after a while is boredom and indifference. not really the definition of a fulfilled life, right? sounds more like an ocean of trouble, with some islands of happy feelings.the verbs for personal happiness are: “to get”, “to feel”, “to achieve”.transpersonal happiness. scientific research in the field of positive psychology, pioneered by dr. martin seligman, phd, proposes that a higher “zone” of happiness is to use one’s unique qualities and perspective in the service of something larger than oneself. this “higher cause” can revolve around family, community, science, art, world reform, spiritual transformation, etc.here, happiness is more of a process, a continuum. a path, rather than an event. and because its cause is larger than one’s ego, so is the resulting joy.have a look at the perma model of happiness to learn more.the verbs for transpersonal happiness are: “to do”, “to grow”, “to impact”transcendental happiness. a more uncommon view of happiness, proposed by many eastern traditions, is that it is our natural state of being. our true self. if it is natural to us, why then is it not experience always? just like health is inherent to our body but is disturbed by bad habits and bad food, happiness is inherent to our heart but disturbed by negative mindsets.the verbs for transcendental happiness are: “to be”, “to discover”, “to transform”.these three “kinds” are not self-excluding. each one has its place and you can have it all.ready to explore what are the causes of true well-being and lasting satisfaction in life? let’s do this!part <NUM> – the essential<NUM>. discover your true valuesthe single most important element in living a fulfilling life is understanding your true personal values, and aligning you existence to them. by “values” i don’t mean personal qualities like “honesty” and “integrity” – i mean those activities & goals that most consume your soul. it is what you are hungry for. those things that you love to think about, read about, talk about, learn about.examples of values: family, building your career, athletic performance, art, spirituality, travelling, being a thought leader, developing your business, etc. it’s more of a doing, not a having.how to discover your values? take some minutes to look deeper into yourself and your life, and it will tell you where you naturally focus your valuable resources (time, energy, money, attention). actually take the time to do this.here are some guiding questions:how do you spend your free time?how do you spend your money?what in your life are you most reliable, disciplined and focused?what do you most think about and dream about?what do you love to learn, read about, and explore?what inspires you the most?fast forward your life <NUM> years and look back. you are proud of achieving one thing. what is that?the elements that appear repeatedly are your core values. it is here that you will find your passion, your direction. they are your map for every single decision in your life. your map for a happy life.this is such a deep topic that it deserves a post of itself (and probably will get). for now, to learn more about core values, i highly recommend the book the breakthrough experience, by dr. john f. demartini, an expert in this field.action step: give yourself <NUM>~<NUM> minutes to contemplate on those questions and discover your core <NUM>-<NUM> values. if you are busy now, put in some time in your calendar for later ?<NUM>. how to be happy? align your life to your valuesyour happiness is where your values are. it is what we want to do, what makes us alive. the more your daily thoughts and activities are in harmony with your values, the happier you are.this is also one of the power tool of coaches.now put your values in order, with the most important ones on top. and examine how much juice they are getting in the different aspects of your life. how much money, time, and energy are you spending on them? are they actively directing your life, your daily choices? or are they being suffocated and forgotten in the maze of the practicalities of living and other less important things? how can your authentic self be more in the steering wheel of your life?action step: understand how much your core values are directing your life or not. commit to making <NUM> simple changes to increase their power.<NUM>. leave aside the unessential – the art of saying “no”are you feeling overwhelmed with tasks? maybe lacking headspace, or direction in life? then you might have said yes to many things that are not truly essential, or not in harmony with your personal values. therefore, there is no space to move, or not enough energy to build what is really meaningful for you.that extra project you took; the extra credit card; the relationship you are keeping and you don’t really care about; the stuff you bought and don’t really need; the old habits that are lurking around but have no meaning anymore.when making decisions, every “yes” is a commitment to something, and a closure to other things. it is allowing something – an activity, a place, a person, a task – to occupy valuable resources in your life. you can produce more money, but the time spent on something or someone will never come back. saying “yes” to anything also demands our commitment of energy and headspace (an increasingly rare commodity these days).the inability to say no is actually rooted in fear. fear of missing out an opportunity; fear of closing a door that we can never again reopen. but we simply cannot have it all. and we fail to see that this fear is actually the very cause that makes us close many other doors. to explore more on this, check out dan ariely’s classic predictably irrational.“is this thing i`m thinking of saying ‘yes’ to gonna supporting my core values or not?”, “how is this decision affect my present and future self?” answering these questions, from moment to moment, is the human journey. in simple terms, our life, impact, and well-being, is determined by what we say yes to. it is a collective of yeses and nos.“no” is not a negative word. it is not aggressive. it is not rejection. it is not selfish.it is focus.“no” is a powerful word, and can be used powerfully. all geniuses of humanity – in art, sport, politics, literature, science – were saying “yes” to a few things, and “no” to everything else. they were not chasing the next shining object.“i don’t know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody” (bill cosby)<NUM>the contemplation of our finite nature, of limitation, of death, pushes human beings to accomplish extraordinary things, to live amazing lives. that is why many people that go through near-death experiences have their life transformed. for the better. they stop saying yes to things that don’t really matter to them, and start focusing on what is really important.that is why the movement of minimalism is gaining traction in modern society. for more on this topic, i recommend joshua becker’s blog, becoming minimalist, and this ted talk.the foundation of a “happy life”, therefore, is to discover our core values, align our life and actions to them, and religiously say “no” to all the needless things that are not in service. trust your heart and your gut if you feel that a person or activity is simply not for you.action step: write down <NUM> things you want to start saying “no” to in life. take note of what you are losing (time, energy, money, head space) by allowing those things to creep in.<NUM>. act based on creative freedom – not conditioningsince birth we have been exposed to so much conditioning – from our family, friends, society, media, environment. and still continue to be bombarded by thousands of messages every day. these outside voices have been heard and repeated so many times that they start having an independent life inside of us. no wonder it is hard to find our true voice, as opposed to the voice of other people’s opinions. yet, we only find fulfilment and freedom by following our own unique voice – our “personal legend”, as paulo coelho would have it. so what to do?the key is to discover what our core values are. this process can take time to mature in us. taking some time alone, apart from all that is familiar from us, can help. meditation, travel & retreats can give us the space to discover ourselves. a life coach can also be of service.according to australian nurse bronnie ware, who spent many years working with patients on their last weeks of life, the top regret of the dying is “i wish i’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.”your values will be your rule of thumb when deciding what is your voice and what is conditioning.action step: next time you feel unsure what path to take, use your core values to discern your true path from your conditioning. be determined to act based on your higher good, and not based on what you believe you “should do”.<NUM>. live the present, but don’t hunt the short-termbeing exclusively present-oriented or future oriented are both points of unbalanceto be in the trap that “i`ll be happy when…” is a cause of unhappiness. to be missing or sacrificing the present – the beautiful nature, the human relations, the rest needed, the peace and joy of being here and breath – is a cause of unhappiness. believing happiness to be “in the future” is not only a risky assumption, but also betrays the concept of happiness as a state of being. it is not in the achievement of your goals – it is in the process of living your values.but to live as if there is no tomorrow, to focus only on short-term goals is the other extreme of this scale. and is not sustainable either.in his classic book, emotional intelligence, daniel goleman describes an experiment in which four-year old kids are left in a room alone and told they can have two marshmallows if they wait for the experimenter to return from an errand. if they can’t wait till then, they can have only one marshmallow, but they can have it now.some kids were able to hold off the fifteen to twenty minutes while others jumped on the one marshmallow – almost always within seconds. years later the same kids were interviewed, and goleman discovered that their ability to delay gratification revealed a great deal about the trajectory that child would likely take in their lives. the scholar concluded that “there is perhaps no psychological skill more fundamental than resisting impulse.”it is curious that many times our success in the short-term is exactly the reason of our failure in the long-term.living day by day with a higher direction in mind, yet with our feet on the ground, seems to be the balance point between present and future. a balance between enjoying the now and designing the future.action step: take note of <NUM> things that you are sacrificing in your present, for the promise of a better future. then write down <NUM> places in your life where your focus on short-term goals may be harming the long-term direction you want for your life. you now know what tweaks you can make so you can be both more present, and also focused on the right things.<NUM>. don’t chase extrinsic valueswhile focus on extrinsic life values may lead to a quicker satisfaction of these desires, true fulfilment will not be found down this path. on the other hand, there are countless testimonials of people that focused first on the “important stuff” in life and, as a result, also got the extrinsic goals met.there is a lot of research in this sense. phd professor ronald inglehart, found that once middle-class comforts are in place, the link between wealth and wellbeing “is surprisingly weak (indeed, virtually negligible).”in his best-selling book on the science of motivation,why we do what we do, edward deci tells us:“the researchers found that if any of the three extrinsic aspirations – for money, fame, or beauty – was very high for an individual relative to the three intrinsic aspirations, the individual was also more likely to display poorer mental health. for example, having an unusually strong aspiration for material success was associated with narcissism, anxiety, depression, and poorer social functioning as rated by a trained clinical psychologist…in contrast, strong aspirations for any of the intrinsic goals – meaningful relationships, personal growth, and community contributions – were positively associated with well-being. people who strongly desired to contribute to their community, for example, had more vitality and higher self-esteem. when people organize their behavior in terms of intrinsic strivings (relative to extrinsic strivings) they seem more content – they feel better about who they are and display more evidence of psychological health.”action step: review your core values. what is driving you in life? are these extrinsic values or intrinsic values? if they are extrinsic, what is the bigger value behind them?<NUM>. be careful how you feed your sensesour body is fed by food, water, and other elements; our mind is fed through ideas and the five senses. the quality of our mind and internal wellbeing is profoundly formed by the things we see, listen to, watch, smell, touch, read, think about, etc. how are you feeding your senses?the music you choose to hear affects your moods. depending on the genre, it can make you inspired, calm, emotional; or violent, depressed, confused. the same goes with the movies we watch, books we read, and all other types of media, environment, food (here and here), and people.action step: make a list of the top five things that you are feeding your senses and do not serve your wellbeing. reflect whether you really need these things in your life or not. commit to one small change.<NUM>. find a place of flow“flow” is that beautiful state of total integration in your present activity. you are there with your whole body, mind and soul, and its as if you disappear, and there is nothing else in the world. total concentration.maybe it is when you are running, or reading a great book, or giving a speech, or drawing. perhaps when thinking deeply about some matter, or when meditating. different people access the flow according to their own passion. it is what moves artists, athletes, writers, and entrepreneurs to give their whole selves into their project. it is also one of the cornerstones of the daoist philosophy.mihaly csikszentmihalyi, author of finding flow, and one of the pioneers in this research, wrote:“in all the activities people in our study reported engaging in, enjoyment comes at a very specific point: whenever the opportunities for action perceived by the individual are equal to his or her capabilities. playing tennis, for instance, is not enjoyable if the two opponents are mismatched. the less skilled player will feel anxious, and the better player will feel bored. the same is true for every other activity… enjoyment appears at the boundary between boredom and anxiety, when the challenges are just balanced with the person’s capacity to act.”to expand on this topic, check out this article on the blog pursuit-of-happiness.action step: what are the activities in your life that you are more likely to find flow? how can you deepen your involvement in these activities?<NUM>. nurture your spiritualityseveral studies point out the relationship between spiritual development and personal well-being. a <NUM> review of more than <NUM> studies of mainly adult populations found that out of those <NUM> studies, <NUM> (<NUM>%) found only positive associations between religiosity/spirituality and well-being.for some people, spirituality come through their religion; but spirituality and religion are different things. you can be spiritual without being religious – that is, without joining any religion or church.spirituality does not require you do give your power away to some external person or institution, nor to have blind faith; it is not dogmatic nor ritualistic. it is not a cult. it does not limit your freedom and it does not make you close minded. as a side note, there studies that show benefits of meditation regardless of belief or religious inclination.true spirituality is an invitation to look deeper into your life, your values, and discover your true self.exploring this topic more in-depth will be a subject of other posts. for now, you can start by reading some meditation quotes.action step: start looking for ways to develop your spirituality, a deeper perspective and values in life.<NUM>. master your mindbuddhism and other ancient traditions emphasise that our mind can be our greatest friend or our worst enemy. it can make our life heaven or hell.“more than those who hate you, more than all your enemies, an undisciplined mind does greater harm.” – the buddhathere is no doubt about this – there can be no happiness while we are enslaved by our own shadows. no factor seems to be more important for our wellbeing than the state of our minds. and yet, for the average person up to <NUM>% of ones thoughts is negative self-talk. this leads to emotional overload and stress.“ok, i get it”, i hear you say, “but how to control the mind?”. thing is, you cannot control the first thought that arises in the mind in any given situation – that is simply a conditioned response. but you can exercise control over the second thought and the ones after. here lies your power (and responsibility).for example, i`m sitting in the couch in a sunday afternoon and the thought arises “i`m lonely”. whether i “accept” this and continue on this train of thought (“yeah, nobody loves me…”, etc.) or simply let it pass, its my choice. i can also choose to instead think “yes, i`m alone at this moment, but its good, i need some self-space”. one way leads to anxiety, victimization and self-pity – the other doesn’t.thousands of times per day we make choices like this, although most times it is automatic and we are not aware of it. becoming aware of our mind processes and exercising our power to direct our attention is the mastery of the mind. and this is greatly facilitated by practices such as meditation and mindfulness. there are also techniques developed by psychologists.the message, here, is that the way you feel, the way you think, is not a necessity. it is merely a learned habit. it is, in great part, arbitrary. you have the power to change it. you are giving power to your thoughts by thinking them, by engaging in a conversation with them, and believing them. if they are creating suffering, remember that you have the power to think something different.the mind cannot hold on to two opposite feelings at the same time, so focusing on developing positive thought patterns and emotions already goes a long way. watch mathieu ricard (ex-phd scientist turned monk) expand on this.action step: become aware of your internal dialogs. be vigilant of your negative thoughts. next time negative thinking kicks in, exercise your power to redirect your thoughts to something else, to reinterpret the facts, or to simply ignore. in the beginning you will succeed only for a few seconds. with practice and persistence, however, it becomes natural and easy.part <NUM> – mindset & attitudessome mindsets empower a life of success and fulfilment; others create difficulties and pain. these can be learned by experience (the hard way), by reading good personal development material, by engaging with mentors and life coaches, or by reflection and meditation. here are my findings from these learning paths.<NUM>. face everything as an opportunity to grow.this is probably the most empowering attitude i’ve ever encountered. it is a good medicine against many of the causes of fear, frustration, impatience, anxiety, and stress.if you face every event, every challenge, as part of the way, then nothing can disturb you. you will not fear, nor complain, nor blame, nor be pissed off by things that happen. instead, in your mind there will be only the question: “what can i learn from this?”.an event doesn’t mean anything by itself; it is always only what you make of it. you have the power to make it positive or negative.you get a “no” as an answer. your car breaks. it’s raining on a sunday again. you can’t finish your project. got sick. nobody is buying your product. your son doesn’t listen to you.you can resist these things. close yourself up. fight them. you now have a problem, and that is unfortunate.or you can be open. breath deeply. acknowledge what is there. look for your lesson, and for the next step. you now simply have a new context, and that is an opportunity.performance psychologist john eliot, author of the somewhat controversial overachievement, has a very interesting expression: “eat stress like an energy bar”. yes, even emotions like stress, anger, envy, can be used for something positive, as motivators for action. depending on our attitude these energies can be empowering or disempowering.life’s challenges are polishing you, preparing you for bigger things.action step: next time a challenge comes, kiss its face, learn the lesson, and move on.<NUM>. expectation creates disappointmentexpectation is wishful thinking about the future. it sets a self-imposed standard of what is to happen. a bit like drawing a line on the sand and deciding that “if it is above this line i`ll be happy; if not, i`ll be upset”.some expectations are natural, and not as harmful. when i buy a product from the supermarket, i expect it to not be rotten, and will have an unpleasant surprise if it is.other expectations, however, are just a recipe for disaster. for instance, expecting things to be easy when learning something, or working on my business, or trying to navigate through life, will create a lot of frustration. if, instead, i expect things to be hard, i’ll be well prepared. if they turn out to be easy, i`m happy; if they turn out to be hard… well, no surprises here. after all, usually what is worth having doesn’t comes easy.similarly, hoping to get lucky, to be accepted, to have quick success, to have no conflicts – all these expectations bring about pain. we’d be better off just doing what we need to do and leaving the future to take care of itself.while it may be impossible to live without any expectations at all, when we learn to be more conservative and “soft” about our expectations, we suffer less the consequences of their violation. keeping in mind that they are arbitrary and self-imposed, we tend to have more flexibility and flow.manage your expectations, and you will rarely be disappointed.check out also the create posts about the subject on lifehacker, huffington post and tiny buddha.action step: what needless expectations are you imposing on yourself right now? do you really need them?<NUM>. yesterday is graveyard… how to forget the past and reinvent your historyvictimization, remorse, guilt, regret. no doubt these are unhappy feelings, and they all have something in common: they are anchored in the past.what are you dwelling on? your past failures? a betrayal? a gaffe you made on the last dinner party? something unjust that happened to you?the past is good for one thing only: learning. we need to reflect on what has happened, learn from it, and move on.your past does not define you – unless you allow it to. you are not what has happened to you; you are what you choose to become. you mind defines you. and mind creates what it constantly thinks about. suddenly over thinking the past doesn’t sound like a good idea anymore…it is usually pain (and not pleasure), that keeps us looking back. the desire to “correct” the past is one of the main reasons why we get stuck in it. and yet this desire goes against a basic law of nature.if we reflect deeply about how this tendency is hurting our present, how it is hindering our life here and now, we will have the motivation needed to make a decision to let go and stop looking back. of course, if possible it also helps to get physically apart from places and people who take you back to your past.another approach is to actually reinvent your past. yes, it is possible, and it is not hallucination. the fact is, the past that we remember is what we have subjectively experienced, not the raw facts. it is the facts + our thinking/feeling. it is not reality, but rather our colourful description of it – and we have the power to change this. if somebody did something bad to us, we cannot start believing that they simply didn’t do that (we actually can, but that’s delusional); but we can change our belief about what that means to us.and that basically changes everything, because for the rest of our life we will remember our story of the event, it’s ending, and not the experience of the event.morty lefkoe, author of the best-seller re-create your life, teaches a process that can be used to reinterpret past events in a simple way:identify the undesirable pattern name the underlying belief identify the source of the belief in memory, including as much sensory detail as possible describe possible alternate interpretations of the memory realize that your original belief is an interpretation, not reality consciously choose to reject the original belief as “false” consciously choose to accept your reinterpretation as “true”both interpretations are valid. your reality will be defined by the one you choose to accept. your choice.action step: identify where in your past you usually get stuck in, and go through the reinterpretation process.<NUM>. accept the things you cannot control or changewhether we like it or not, many things in life we cannot change. we cannot change other people, nor the behaviour of the market. other things can be changed, but only with colossal effort during a long period of time.accepting reality is not a passive attitude. it does not make us weak. it does require humility, of course, but it empowers us to respond to life in a wiser, more effective, way.we cannot fight all battles. so let’s choose wisely what to accept, andwhat to focus to change.action step: are you struggling to accept some major reality in yourself or your life? what would happen if instead of asking “how can i change this” you asked “how can i make use of this?”<NUM>. move in the direction of your fearsyes, you read that right.have this determination that no fear must arise unmet. have this obsession that every fear must be confronted and conquered. this unleashing of your inner hero will deepen your life and broaden your heart.fear is one of the most instinctive human emotions. it can take many forms, such as worry (fear about future circumstances), doubt (fear about making the wrong choice) and hatred (the aggressive response to the feared object). most likely you will experience it your whole life, so it might be a good idea to learn how to deal with it.the problem is not that fear arises. the problem, if any, is how you respond to it. yes, believe it or not, you have total freedom as to how to respond. maybe it is hard to experience it, because you might not have exercised this mind-muscle much. but it’s there.experiencing danger & risk, can be character building as well. even for your kids.a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor. and skilled sailors have a depth in their live that novices don’t.happy are those that are bigger than their fears. and how to be bigger than your fear? act bigger than your fear. when in doubt, close your eyes and take the leap. don’t cling to something just because of fear. it makes you a prisoner.hey! fear is not a big deal. just some electrical impulses in your brain, coupled with a bit of chemicals running through your blood. will this keep you powerless while life runs you by?action step: think of something that makes you afraid. take one small step every day in the direction of that fear. it’s important that it be a small step, otherwise you may lose motivation. feel the confidence that comes from acting despite the fear. gradually increase the boldness of your actions.<NUM>. embrace impermanencenot understanding and accepting impermanence is a cause of unhappiness.impermanence is the fundamental law of our existence. this is the only thing that is certain in this life: everything changes. time eats away everything, and nothing remains the same. your time will be spent. money will be gone. many things that you cared about will either disappear, or you will no longer care about them.the good news is that whatever negative feeling or unpleasant situation you are experiencing will also pass. there was a time when it did not exist; then it shows up for a limited time, and after that it goes back to not existing.several ancient traditions emphasised the need to contemplate the fleeting nature of our lives, from buddha to the stoics (who called this exercise memento mori).a deeper life opens up when we understand and embrace impermanence and our mortality, and learn its lessons. a deep (and often unnoticed) fear in our hearts is released once we accept impermanence down to our bones. as a result we get more focused, and we are freed up to live a more amazing life.action step: spend some time reflecting about how everything constantly changes. think of something that you are very attached to, or a situation that is bothering you. realize that this too shall pass.<NUM>. happy thoughts – choosing optimism, choosing happinessyes, wellbeing and happiness is a matter of choice.“habits of thinking need not be forever. one of the most significant findings in psychology in the last twenty years is that individuals can choose the way they think.” – martin seligman from learned optimismin this wonderful book the author explains the difference between optimism and the (much in vogue) “positive thinking”: the former is learning a new set of cognitive skills, while the later is repeating “positive affirmations” to yourself. and the skills we need to learn is that of changing our “explanatory styles”, which is how we chose to talk to ourselves when interpreting what’s happening.the following experiment was made with two dogs. the first dog is slightly shocked but has a lever he can push to stop the shocks. he quickly learns to stop the shocks. he’s in good “psychological” shape. a second dog does not have a lever, so he can’t stop the shocks. his shocks stop only when the first dog hits his lever. so, in effect, the shocks are random for him. our second dog “learns” that he is helpless in the face of these shocks.here’s what’s fascinating: the dogs are then moved to a new area and taught a new way to avoid the shocks. so, now they can both avoid the shocks at will. remarkably, although the first dog avoids the shocks, the second dog curls up in the corner and whimpers as the shock – which he could have avoided – is administered. he has learned helplessness.the second dog may feel sorry for himself. he may blame the first dog. he may complain. all of these are disempowering.or he may learn to see things differently.we condition ourselves through our own self-talk, and then become prisoners of our interpretations, and blind to reality. whether you tell yourself that you can or can’t, you are right. that is why if you want to create instant change in your life, watching your self-language seems a great place to start. how you describe your reality is how you define it, how you create it.here is the model the author proposes for an optimist explanatory style:permanence – is what happened likely to continue? optimists think that if it’s a bad thing it’s a fluke. if it’s a good thing, they tend to think it’s permanent. the opposite holds true for the pessimist: good things are the flukes and bad things are more likely to recur.– is what happened likely to continue? optimists think that if it’s a bad thing it’s a fluke. if it’s a good thing, they tend to think it’s permanent. the opposite holds true for the pessimist: good things are the flukes and bad things are more likely to recur. pervasiveness – does it reflect your whole life? is it “universal” or is it “specific”? with a good event, the optimist is more likely to extend it to her whole life. with a bad event, she will tend to isolate the incident as specific to that situation. the opposite holds true for the pessimist.– does it reflect your whole life? is it “universal” or is it “specific”? with a good event, the optimist is more likely to extend it to her whole life. with a bad event, she will tend to isolate the incident as specific to that situation. the opposite holds true for the pessimist. personalisation – is it internal or external? something good happens. an optimist pats himself on the back (internal), thinking he did a good job. if the same thing happens to a pessimist, he is more likely to attribute the success to luck, other people’s hard work, or something else outside of his control (external).how we interpret events can maximise happiness and energize us, or make us feel terrible. and the good news is: it’s in our power to decide. it is an emotional intelligence skill that can be developed.of course, many situations in life call for a dose of pessimism, caution, and “defensive thinking”, so our optimism should not blind us either. like anything in excess, irrational optimism is also harmful – though arguably less harmful than irrational pessimism. so maybe this section should be called “choosing balanced optimism”.true optimism is more a reaction to the present than an expectation about the future. it is not about blindly believing that things will always turn out he best. that violates the principle of managing your expectations (see point <NUM>). true optimism is about choosing to interpret events in a positive light when they do happen. and not being attached to past negative talk. it is being open that anything can happen, yet at the same time confident that “i can do something positive with anything that comes”.there are several studies on how being optimistic positively affects physical and mental health (<NUM>, <NUM>), romantic relationships, athletic performance, career, business and the economy.check out this article to read more on optimism & positive psychology, and this one about how happiness is also a deliberate choice.action step: identify three places in your life you are having negative self-talk. how could you have a more empowering interpretation of that situation? is the negative self-talk based on reality now, or mere learned habit?<NUM>. be wrongneeding to be right all the time can be extremely limiting and energy consuming. having the courage to be vulnerable and accept one’s mistakes is liberating. whether you accept it not, reality is that many times you will be wrong. by saying, “i was wrong” more often – to yourself and others – you will find more compassion, humility and flexibility. people will trust you more.it is good to always aim for the highest – as long as we understand that perfection is unattainable, both in work and in relationships. nothing is perfect; even the earth is not perfectly round. you will invariably make bad decisions.understanding how often we are wrong makes us be more compassionate towards ourselves. we see that many times we simply did the best we could at that time – we need is to educate ourselves, not punish ourselves. we will also tend to criticise others less, and be more empathetic, which will improve our social relations. humility pays off.personally, it was not easy for me to accept and practice this lesson. but once i tried a few times, i started taking pleasure in it. there is a certain unburdening of the heart that happens, which makes it worth it even if only for that feeling. my values and points of view were changing by time, even to something opposite, and i saw that contradicting myself was a sign of growth, not confusion or unreliability.action step: is it hard for you to accept being wrong? if so, try this: look back and see some opinion you had that you now see was wrong. or maybe some bad decision. then clearly express that you were wrong to a person involved in that situation. depending on the magnitude of what happened, this “little” act can save a relationship, a company, a life.<NUM>. have some trustone of the qualities of developing your spirituality is the trust on something larger than yourself. call it god, the universe, dharma, life – doesn’t matter. it’s not about a whimsical expectation that things will happen according to your preference, but a faith that things will happen in favor of your greater good. it’s a conviction that, if you put your best foot forward, the universe will respond.does one really need trust? no. but life is more beautiful with it. trust in something larger accomplishes four important things:makes you optimistic (section <NUM>)decreases your worries and doubts, allowing you to forget about the future and focus more on the presentforces you to accept things you cannot changetakes you out of your little worldyou are less prone to mental masturbation of “what if…”there is also scientific evidence that trust makes us happy. and here is a podcast episode where one of my guests speaks about the value of surrender.action step: is it time to take a leap of faith somewhere in your life? how would your feelings and actions be different if you had more trust?<NUM>. dare to disagree“it’s always better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb than the top of the one you don’t” marc and angel chernoff.free yourself from the crowd mentality. be a lion. you will not find happiness in the life of a sheep – at most comfort.the lion finds his own path, or carves one out if none is found. the sheep follows the beaten road.the lion walks alone if needed, and is fearless. the sheep is fearful and moves in herds.the lion roars loud and clear. the sheep’s sound is weak and hesitant.the lion rests deep, confident he can handle any challenge. the sheep is worried about tomorrow.the lion makes the news. the sheep reads the news.the lion creates and innovates. the sheep follows standards and repeats patterns.the lion will fight, even though wounded. the sheep will run, even before a fight.“be a light unto yourself”, as the buddha said. sing your own song. the world needs your unique gift, presence, perspective. no need to apologise for your existence and your dreams.action step: are you being a sheep in any place in your life? awaken the lion within.<NUM>. money matters, but not reallywhat can money do for you, and how much of it do you really need?it’s a huge topic. but for the purposes of this post we can say there are broadly three types of attitudes when it comes to money:it’s not important (and other limiting beliefs)it’s extremely important and the reason of my effortsmoney is a resource, and its important for my life, but it’s not a measure of success or happinessthe first two will make you make you suffer. the balanced point of view will set you in the right path.there is plenty of research concluding that money does matter, but that once a certain threshold of comfort is achieved (some studies suggest <NUM>~<NUM>k a year), it matters less and less to the overall wellbeing of the person. after the basic needs of life of oneself and one’s family are met, to continue to chase money is more a cause of dissatisfaction than fulfillment (refer to point number <NUM> of this post), especially if driven by peer comparison pressure and consumerism. the most valuable thing money can buy is time, and it is how you use your time that will determine how happy you are.once the point of comfort has been reached, feeling happy with what we have, and focusing our efforts on life’s intrinsic values, seems to be the best use of money. also, experiments show that spending it on others can boost our happiness more than spending it on ourselves (see also greatergood and sciencemag).action step: discover what is your attitude about money. are you holding any limiting beliefs, or over-focused on accumulating wealth?<NUM>. do your inner workall of these insights have one thing in common: they require some inner work. these keys are worthless unless you actually use them. you will need to put in some thought about yourself and your life, develop more self-awareness, and then decide to make a change. most people are not taking this path – they are simply looking for patches.solve one problem at its root and you will never need to solve it again. if you keep coming back to the same problems, on the same level, then maybe something is not right.no shortcuts here. no silver bullet. just the pains of personal growth – like giving birth to your new self. designed by you! the results pay off big time.the secret here is to fall in love with the process of growth. with the feeling of freeing oneself from old shackles. enjoying the virtues we are developing.action step: create some space in your life for self-awareness and personal development. nothing will make a bigger impact than this investment in yourself. think what could be your first step in this journey.conclusionwow, you actually read the whole post! i`m grateful for your company ?each of these points is actually quite a big subject, and i attempted to present it

time to think about the long term and late effects, as they are known. these can include secondary cancers, infertility, and heart, bone and lung problems. yeah, right. the first response to ‘you have cancer’ is something along the lines of ‘get it out of me!’. no one wants to wait and weigh the benefits of do we get rid of the cancer or do we worry about the long term effects, if the first cancer doesn’t kill you in the meantime?that’s not happening. now that we know that patients can live and thrive for decades after treatment, perhaps we need cancer treatments which are do not leave long lasting physical scars. i know now there are oral cancer treatments where daily pills can remove the cancer but also bring strong side effects. they are a step in the right direction but we aren’t

trigger<NUM>. most people are actually lactose intolerant and don't know it<NUM>. dairy weakens bones, can lead to osteoporosis and is linked to cancer<NUM>. dairy products are particularly susceptible to radiation contamination(naturalnews) dairy foods make a delicious and satisfying complement to many people's diets. however, there is a large body of evidence that suggests that most people's bodies are just not well equipped to digest and process dairy-based foods and beverages (unless you happen to be a sherpa from the tibetan highlands). and, as our environment gets more polluted, reasons to reduce dairy consumption increase rather than stay the same. here are some convincing reasons to reduce or even eliminate dairy from your diet:consumption of dairy has varying effects on different people. some people are so sensitive to dairy that ingesting even a small amount can be fatal if they have anaphylaxis, a severe, potentially fatal allergic reaction that can result in rashes, swelling, hives, itching, trouble breathing, wheezing or even loss of consciousness. in a separate category from allergenics are people who are lactose intolerant. lactose intolerance happens when a person is lacking lactase, an enzyme which breaks down the lactose sugars in dairy. without lactase, a person cannot break down and digest dairy foods and may experience bloating, cramps, gas and diarrhea.most people in the world are actually lactose intolerant but are unaware of it. it is estimated that <NUM>% of the world's citizens generally lack the lactase enzyme needed to break down lactose into the simpler sugar forms glucose and galactose, which the body can process effectively. for most of the <NUM>th century, it has been generally accepted that almost all humans could break down lactose, but this was proven incorrect by research conducted during the <NUM>s which found that most people lose the lactase enzyme after being weaned as children, usually between the ages of two and five. a small percentage of humans, such as tibetan sherpas and their relatives, do retain the lactase enzyme throughout adulthood, due to evolutionary adaptivity.most of us have been deceived by the usda's nutritional guidelines into believing that dairy is a healthy part of a balanced diet, and that ""diets rich in milk and dairy products help build and maintain bone mass throughout the lifecycle and may reduce the risk of osteoporosis ."" these statements unfortunately are misleading and even dangerous. studies have found that the highest rates of osteoporosis occur in countries with high consumption of animal products. this research suggests that, rather than building strong bones and teeth, dairy products prevent calcium from being absorbed in the body.high quality plant-based foods, such as broccoli, kale and collard greens, provide much more easily absorbable calcium than dairy. these should be used in place of dairy as healthy sources of calcium.there are many other convincing reasons to avoid dairy besides the risk of osteoporosis. research has shown that dairy consumption is linked to cancer, heart disease and diabetes.ever since the fukushima disaster in <NUM>, researchers have been testing foods and vegetables for radioactivity. the department of nuclear engineering at uc berkeley has been taking radiation samples since the fukushima meltdown. they have tested both raw milk and store-bought, and have detected radioactive isotopes cesium-<NUM> and <NUM> (cs-<NUM>, cs-<NUM>). this is alarming when you consider dairy as a ""radioactive indicator"" of our food supply. dairy is a good indicator for radiation, because cows consume grass, food crops and water supplies. in simple terms, when dairy starts testing positive for radioactivity, it's an indication of radioactive contamination of the entire food supply.zach c. miller was raised from an early age to believe in the power and value of healthy-conscious living.

blockchain stocks are next!can the existence of life after death be proven?by: bob daulbyin a confused world of science, religion and society at large whereby, no two people or group seem to agree or reach some kind of common ground that we could all cling to with some hope, the existence of a life existing after death is an ever deepening problem to solve. perhaps then, it can never be solved through a generic means but by and through a personal one instead. perhaps, proof of life after death was never meant for the public at large but only for those willinmg to tread the path that angels fear to tread?what is the problem?if there is a problem at all when trying to establish the existence of a life after our passing here, it is proof. in having read many articles concerning this topic, it can be easily seen that so many of us have ideas – and often, very different ideas at that – but that i have yet to come across just one that will bring each of us this much needed proof.what about death anyway?although most of us will go through life not giving another thought to our sure passing yet, there comes a time in all our lives when we are suddenly confronted with death in such a way that we cannot ignore it any longer. and so, we will ask ourselves then, “will i live on after this life?”as far as i am concerned, death is not something that we should push aside out of dread or ignorance but is something that we should study as soon as we are able to. this is so that, when – not ‘if’ – we are confronted with death, it will not come as a shock and, more importantly, it will also not be a source of grief either but rather, one of joy.existence <NUM> (photo credit: vincepal)through instilled religion, society has taught us to be afraid of death. to compound this fear, we are also taught to ‘pooh-pooh’ or deride the possibility of life existing *after* death – whereby we continue forever onwards *anyway* – as a topic for the ‘ill-advised’ or the ‘ignorant’. to make matters even more fearful and confusing for us, experts, psychics, shamans, priests, ministers or whoever, can not only not bring us this much needed proof but that, should proof ever arise at all then no one agrees that it is. it is because of this lack of agreement – the need to reach common ground – that, we, the public at large, lose out. in short, if there weren’t quite so many egos and wannabes out there believing that they are the only ones who hold ‘the truth’ then, we would not suffer as we do as far as death and a life after death is concerned.and so, in bearing these in mind, it becomes all the more necessary to not only find the existence of life after death but also to be able to prove it leaving us in no doubt that we too – *shall* live on.so, what about proof?in having now been in actual contact with our worlds beyond for a very long time now, from my own experiences, i can now reveal that an all-round, generic proof, of a life existing after our deaths is a long way off if not nigh impossible. until science itself can reach a general consensus – which is highly unlikely (and this because ‘they’ can’t agree either) – then the very idea of finding this irrefutable proof that will cross all boundaries regardless of their origins – is but a distant dream. and so, when skeptics use this angle – the need for the irrefutable – is already a lost argument and so, as they gain, believers lose. most of all, we all lose.so, what is to be done about this?generic vs. personal proofduring my many years of experience with our so-called ‘unknown’, along the way, i have brought even total strangers to my sessions to note, not only their reaction but also as to what they say is ‘proof’. it was during this period of my research that i have discovered that, although generic proof is not yet available yet ‘personal’ proof is. not only is personal proof available but it has been available since man first walked upon this planet.let me give you an example of personal proof.existence (photo credit: photosynthetica)when i first made friends with computers, got myself on the internet etc. to be in actual contact with someone from peru to me, was an out and out miracle. but what compounded that miracle was that, after only a month, i recieved a letter from him which proved to me that he existed and that he did indeed come from peru. to me, this was personal proof of someone i met through this new fangled means of communication at the time.the above is personal proof – for me and only me and yet, to you, this is all a fairy tale. why? because you were not there, you didn’t speak to him, you did not experience any of this and you did not recieve a letter from peru. thus, why should you ‘believe’ me? had you not been taught geography at school then, to you, even peru would not exist would it?ignorance is also taughtunlike me, you have not been taught about the true existence of life after death and so, to you, until you are taught then, you will always doubt and you will always require proof. until you are taught; until you receive your own personal proof, this proof will always elude you.it’s time to learn isn’t it?and so, in having learned and shown that peru really does exist after all, what would the future hold for someone who has given up fickle ‘belief‘ altogether and now *knows* at last?in conclusion:if you are curious as to how you too can remove doubt and fear from your psychi so that you too can venture out into lands previously unknown to you; to also know, exactly what to expect upon your own passing and of how joyful it truly is and why in a very real way leaving behind you the insecurity of tepid beliefs then, by all means, visit my website where you too will find that the door to limitless knowledge

probiotics.consuming fermented vegetables keep bad bacteria and yeast in check, as the lactic acid producing lactobacilli in these foods alter the acidity in the intestine which helps prevent the overgrowth of unfriendly bacteria, molds, and candida.one of the most commonly fermented vegetables is sauerkraut, which simply consists of cabbage, salt, and a culture starter if desired. however, nearly any vegetable can be fermented and can be stored for months and even years under the right conditions.kefir is a fermented drink that can be made from milk, water, grains, and coconut water.

black or green tea, some sugar, and a kombucha starter culture or scoby.apple cider vinegar is a type of vinegar made from fermented apples and has pale to medium amber color. it can be substituted in many food preparations for white vinegar, with exponentially more health benefits.consuming apple cider vinegar will introduce beneficial enzymes, probiotics , and amino acids that will improve digestion, relieve heartburn, stimulate the lymphatic system, help get rid of candida, and help strengthen the immune system.making apple cider vinegar is a double fermentation process. first, apples

decline is hastened by climate change because of the limits that are reached as resources are strained to the breaking as disasters pile up.here is an npr article about this very process unfolding

dying from starvation and disease due to conflicts and drought in nigeria, somalia, south sudan and yemen.so within the u.s. government it’s not just exclusively domestic agencies like fema that are in all-hands-on-deck mode right now. at the cdc, where talley works for a branch that focuses on overseas emergencies, “we have staff around the world responding.”similarly, usaid, the agency that delivers u.s. assistance to poor countries, has deployed six separate disaster response teams — which can consist of as many as several dozen staffers — including teams to help displaced people from syria and iraq.“this is only the second time that we’ve had six teams mobilized at once,” notes alex mahoney, a top official with the agency’s office of u.s. foreign disaster assistance, or ofda.the last time was during the ebola outbreak in west africa. “so yes, it’s unusual,” he says.“it’s well worth reading, and explains that agencies all over the world that rely on u.s. support– including the u.s.!– are stretched to their limits and beyond. donations are dropping in a process that is called “donation fatigue” due to both private parties and governmental organizations using their volunteers and resources until no more of either is left, and replacements are slow to arrive.it appears that any more disasters after this pile up may well face the unthinkable: little to no help at all.the timing appears to be part of the problem with the lack of help for puerto rico, for instance. or the devastating fires in california…. we are at the point where both funds and active participants are just about out of commission.i believe that climate change means more years will be like this last one and that soon– maybe within a decade– it may well be that local disasters will be met with local help and not much more than that, and many devastating disaster survivors will find they are on their own. this would mean that the collapse of modern civilization may take far less time than typical declines of previous eras. the mentality of generosity to strangers could shift to that of battening down the hatches for your own area and people.we all should hope not. the longer we can maintain

her doing that, that i’ve been able to come to you both. and even though i don’t have anything personally to do with marion, as in we don’t speak to each other like i do with you, still i have been with her through her whole life as she’s suffered all her feeling abuse. and by her choosing to live true to herself, which means, true to her feelings, so i’ve been able to come to you and shed more of the conceptual light on it all for you both. and so has then jesus been able to come to you as well, joining me in our revelation to you about all of this – your feeling-denial state, your evilness, your rebellion.sorry mary, but i’m still coming to terms with what you said earlier in the previous post, that really we don’t need any formal religions at all, like, no churches, no priests, no religious men or women, no holy places, no nothing like any of that.that’s right james, you don’t. you can still of course have holy places, and places of worship, prayer and meditation, but these would be places you would go to be with others, or quiet places, to long to your mother and father for their divine love. and as well, such places could simply be places you go to sharing your experiences and expressing your feelings as you seek the truth of them. however, really your whole life is your spiritual experience, you long for the divine love of god when you feel you want to long for it; and you long for the truth of your feelings when you feel you want to long for the truth of them; and you keep striving to express all your feelings to your partner, and ideally, out in the world if other people are also open to it – if they are understanding and sharing the same intention in life.to imagine that one day humanity will not have such religions… that’s hard to imagine.one day it will happen, but not for a long time, however in the mean time, as more people come to understand about the significance of their feelings and their relationship with the truth; and as they venture into doing their feeling-healing, (or soul-healing, which is inclusive of their feeling-healing, together with longing to become at-one with god through longing to the mother and father for their divine love), then less power and control will such institutions have over the world.we are all so heavily indoctrinated into believing so many of our bad feelings are bad and should

your confidenceby carl greer, phd, psyddo you lose confidence after a loss or failure? if it’s a particularly big loss or failure, or part of a series of failures, it may be difficult to have faith in yourself afterward. lost confidence can affect you for years and become embedded in your story as a recurring theme that seems to have a life of its own.even if you try to hide your insecurity, others may pick up on it because you telegraph it though your words, actions, attitudes, and body language. then, no matter how much you try, you seem to have bad luck. you sabotage your successes and don’t know why. failure becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.we’ve all known someone who seems to have an air of desperation and fear about achieving a goal—and that person may be us! most have experienced a loss of confidence and a resulting fear that we’ll never get it back.it can be helpful to think of lost confidence as a lost soul part that separated from you and can be reclaimed and reabsorbed and reintegrated into who you are. through discovering the part of yourself that has confidence in some arena, you can reclaim the energy of confidence and let it propel you forward. if you have failed at business after business or job after job, you might spend some time pursuing an interest that you have achieved success in. you might even discover the seed for a new business. many entrepreneurs have built successful businesses around a talent or skill they had previously undervalued.then too, the energetic imprint of being a failure is simply an aspect of being vulnerable. when we feel insecure, we’re recognizing that we don’t have expertise, that our control is limited, and that we have much to learn. vulnerability and what the buddhists call ‘beginner’s mind’ can be an asset if you need to learn something new.confidence may build as you achieve mastery. recognizing that you are not a master is the first step in becoming one. you may need to learn more about developing a healthy relationship or business partnership. you may need to learn the art of tolerating your discomfort in discovering your weaknesses and holes in your understanding.om times is a leading voice of the

internet to hopefully spread word to the public and those in the scientific community about a pressing matter. he claims the high costs of ‘flagship’ missions are keeping other important and crucial missions stuck on the ‘drawing board.’he says he is worried because the golden age we have been in seems to be coming to an end. sure, no golden age lasts forever but we are putting an end to this one far too soon. there seems to be good reason behind what he is saying.elvis wrote in scientific american as follows:our early successes came from looking through new windows across a vast range of wavelengths invisible to the naked eye. the first radio, x-ray, ultraviolet and infrared telescopes were small, but everything we saw through them was new and mysterious. the next generation of telescopes leaped forward in capabilities, leading to the discoveries of neutron stars, black holes, radiation left over from the big bang, dark matter, dark energy, dark energy, exoplanets … the list goes on.but this greater power came at a cost—literally since each new generation of telescopes carried a price tag several times higher than that of the one before. today, a single telescope can now take almost a full decade’s worth of nasa’s budget for “big astronomy.” the james webb space telescope (jwst), now scheduled for launch next year, takes the prize at about $<NUM> billion.the glory of our golden age has been that we can access the whole electromagnetic spectrum at the same time. the discovery of gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars is a perfect example: ground-based detectors spotted these ripples in spacetime, but follow-up observations with gamma-ray, x-ray and visible-light telescopes gave us a far more complete understanding of how the event unfolded. ideally, we need several comparably sensitive “flagship” telescopes, on a par with jwst, and they need to be flying at the same time.yet such flagships are only designed to last about five years (although that can often be stretched to <NUM>). when the infrared-sensitive jwst flies, it will be <NUM> to <NUM> times more powerful than its predecessors, the hubble and spitzer space telescopes. but if new flagships cost as much as jwst, it will be a decade before even one can be launched. by that time jwst itself will likely be on its last legs. so every discovery made by the webb telescope will take over a decade to follow up. by then, we’ll have forgotten what it was that we wanted to know in the first place. advances in astronomy will slow to a snail’s pace.elvis says that the way we respond to crises like this make a huge difference in how things go down. he noted that we do not have to simply accept this. we can respond in a different manner and change the outcome. he believes a new program needs to be put in place and it should be one requiring multiple new missions. you can read his full article by clicking here or in the video below. what do you

than <NUM> percent of marine life and <NUM> percent of land animals. catastrophic environmental changes also resulted from the mass extinction and scientists now know that siberian volcanoes set the whole thing into motion.scientists at new york university (nyu) have discovered new evidence to show that the great permian mass extinction was caused by massive volcanic eruptions. by analyzing rocks, researchers have discovered evidence for a global spike in the element nickel at the time of the extinction. using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, which measures the abundance of rare elements at their atomic level, the scientists documented anomalous peaks of nickel in regions ranging from the arctic to india at the time of the great permian extinction. they say this is most likely to have come from huge volcanic eruptions, as rocks formed from cooling lava contain some of the biggest nickel deposits on the planet.nyu geologist michael rampino explained that exploding volcanoes in siberia likely caused intense global warming, which was recorded in the oceans and on land during the extinction. the eruptions would have also released huge amounts of

that would transmit through the earths atmosphere. the experiments that tesla conducted, in high voltage electricity, led to the discover that both time and space could be deformed, so long as a door

the rockefeller trilateral commission exposed its own secret% of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents.headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!now and then, i republish an explosive interview with two rockefeller trilateral commission members, highlighting how much political power can be controlled in a few hands.people often misunderstand how the game works. in the area of us foreign policy, for example, they focus on the long-standing rats’ nest called the state department.well, they should. but that bureaucracy implements policy. it doesn’t really formulate the basics. the basics come from higher on the food chain.the globalist movement—within which the trilateral commission is a leading force—dictates a “one-world” theme. separate nations and their power should be melted down and folded into one planet-wide management system.this system would ultimately determine worldwide production quotas for goods and services, and their distribution. energy, in particular, is a prime target. how much will be created? who will benefit? who will suffer?the us federal government and other governments around the world are currently trying to bring us closer to that “utopian day.”who sits in the shadows pulling their strings?here is another question that has the same answer: who is in charge of undermining free markets and thus taking down economies?one group has been virtually forgotten. its influence is enormous. it has existed since <NUM>.it’s called the trilateral commission (tc).keep in mind that the original stated goal of the tc was to create “a new international economic order.”in <NUM>, four years before birthing the tc with david rockefeller, zbigniew brzezinski wrote: “[the] nation state as a fundamental unit of man’s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force. international banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state.”goodbye, separate nations.any doubt on the question of tc goals is answered by david rockefeller himself, the founder of the tc, in his memoirs (<NUM>): “some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the united states, characterizing my family and me as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure—one world, if you will. if that is the charge, i stand guilty, and i am proud of it.”patrick wood, author of trilaterals over washington, points out there are only <NUM> members of the trilateral commission who live in america. obama appointed eleven of them to posts in his administration.for example: tim geithner, treasury secretary;james jones, national security advisor;paul volker, chairman, economic recovery committee;dennis blair, director of national intelligence.here is a stunning piece of forgotten history, a <NUM> conversation between a us reporter and two members of the trilateral commission. (source: trilateralism: the trilateral commission and elite planning for world management; ed. by holly sklar, <NUM>, south end press, pages <NUM>-<NUM>).the conversation was public knowledge at the time.anyone who was anyone in washington politics, in media, in think-tanks, had access to it. understood its meaning.but no one shouted from the rooftops. no one used the conversation to force a scandal. no one protested loudly.the conversation revealed that the entire basis of the us constitution had been torpedoed, that the people who were running us national policy (which includes trade treaties) were agents of an elite shadow group. no question about it.and yet: official silence. media silence. the dept. of justice made no moves, congress undertook no serious inquiries, and the president, jimmy carter, issued no statements. carter was himself an agent of the trilateral commission in the white house. he had been plucked from obscurity by david rockefeller, and through elite tc press connections, vaulted into the spotlight as a pre-eminent choice for the presidency.the <NUM> conversation featured reporter, jeremiah novak, and two trilateral commission members, karl kaiser and richard cooper. the interview took up the issue of who exactly, during president carter’s administration, was formulating us economic and political policy.the careless and off-hand attitude of trilateralists kaiser and cooper is astonishing. it’s as if they’re saying, “what we’re revealing is already out in the open, it’s too late to do anything about it, why are you so worked up, we’ve already won…”novak (the reporter): is it true that a private [trilateral committee] led by henry owen of the us and made up of [trilateral] representatives of the us, uk, west germany, japan, france and the eec is coordinating the economic and political policies of the trilateral countries [which would include the us]?cooper: yes, they have met three times.novak: yet, in your recent paper you state that this committee should remain informal because to formalize ‘this function might well prove offensive to some of the trilateral and other countries which do not take part.’ who are you afraid of?kaiser: many countries in europe would resent the dominant role that west germany plays at these [trilateral] meetings.cooper: many people still live in a world of separate nations, and they would resent such coordination [of policy].novak: but this [trilateral] committee is essential to your whole policy. how can you keep it a secret or fail to try to get popular support [for its decisions on how trilateral member nations will conduct their economic and political policies]?cooper: well, i guess it’s the press’ job to publicize it.novak: yes, but why doesn’t president carter come out with it and tell the american people that [us] economic and political power is being coordinated by a [trilateral] committee made up of henry owen and six others? after all, if [us] policy is being made on a multinational level, the people should know.cooper: president carter and secretary of state vance have constantly alluded to this in their speeches. [a lie]kaiser: it just hasn’t become an issue.this interview slipped under the mainstream media radar, which is to say, it was buried.us economic and political policy—run by a committee of the trilateral commission.when jimmy carter won the presidential election in <NUM>, his aide, hamilton jordan, said that if after the inauguration, cy vance and brzezinski came on board as secretary of state and national security adviser, “we’ve lost. and i’ll quit.” lost—because both men were powerful members of the trilateral commission and their appointment to key positions would signal a surrender of white house control to the commission.vance and brzezinski were appointed secretary of state and national security adviser, as jordan feared. but he didn’t quit. he became carter’s chief of staff.now consider the vast propaganda efforts of the past <NUM> years, on so many levels, to install the idea that all nations and peoples of the world are a single collective.from a very high level of political and economic power, this propaganda op has had the objective of grooming the population for a planet that is one coagulated mass, run and managed by one force. a central engine of that force is the trilateral commission.how does a shadowy group like the tc accomplish its goal? one basic strategy is: destabilize nations; ruin their economies; send millions and millions of manufacturing jobs off to places where virtual slave labor does the work; adding insult to injury, export the cheap products of those slave-factories back to the nations who lost the jobs and undercut their domestic competitors, forcing them to close their doors and fire still more employees.and then solve that economic chaos by bringing order.what kind of order?eventually, one planet, with national borders erased, under one management system, with a planned global economy, “to restore stability,” “for the good of all, for lasting harmony.”“i pledge allegiance to the trilateral commission, and to the domination for which it stands, one planet, indivisible, with tyranny and poverty and top-down order for all…”delivered by the daily sheeplewe encourage you to share and

<NUM>!“the cold blooded assassination of black men and women” – art: arkee chaney, a<NUM>, p.o. box <NUM>, galesburg il <NUM>. lapd didn’t succeed in assassinating benny powell, but their <NUM>-year vendetta against him illustrates the mindset that allows cops to allege – with impunity – that any retaliation against a black person is excusable by claiming they feared for their lives.i want to reveal to the public the years of persecution and false imprisonment i have been forced to endure by the certain lapd detectives who had previously framed me for the murder of an off-duty deputy sheriff in los angeles. i, along with my then co-defendant, clarence chance were convicted in <NUM> on false evidence fabricated by these lapd detectives for the sole purpose of gaining our conviction even though these detectives knew we were innocent of committing this offense.in <NUM>, through the help and assistance of an innocence project based in princeton, new jersey, the centurion ministries, we were able to prove our innocence through a petition for writ of habeas corpus after serving <NUM> plus years in false imprisonment.the day of our release, the then chief of police in los angeles called a press conference wherein he refuted the findings of the superior court judge who granted our exoneration and release. the los angeles city council called for his immediate resignation or face being fired for his statements to the public through the press.i want to reveal to the public the years of persecution and false imprisonment i have been forced to endure by the certain lapd detectives who had previously framed me for the murder of an off-duty deputy sheriff in los angeles.regardless, the chief’s statements caused a vendetta against me to develop in various law enforcement circles who believed this chief’s statements against our exoneration. i was the more outspoken of mr. chance and myself, so they focused more attention of their hatred and anger on me.i was soon thereafter shot five times by a caucasian but otherwise unknown assailant in phoenix, arizona, and the phoenix police department refused to investigate, locate or prose­cute this person who attempted to take my life. a friend of mine from high school who was, at that time, a high ranking official within the phoenix police department told me that the person who had attempted to take my life was a plain clothes lapd officer who had been following me to take my life.both mr. chance and i sued the city and county of los angeles for wrongful conviction and false imprisonment, and we both were awarded multi-million-dollar settlements. i was awarded $<NUM>.<NUM> million, allegedly, and was to have received the bulk of this payment july <NUM>, <NUM>. i was shot on june <NUM>, <NUM>.on july <NUM>, <NUM>, i received a phone call at my home in scottsdale, arizona, that my settlement had been paid to the law office of cary w. medill in beverly hills, california, and some of this payment had been wired to my account at my bank in scottsdale.i went to my bank in scottsdale to see what had been sent me, but no money had been wired to my account from medill’s law office. as i left the bank i was arrested on a felony warrant arising out of riverside county califor­nia alleging <NUM> counts of sexual assault on a female.once i arrived back in california, the counts were raised to <NUM>. as the en­closed synopsis intimates, i was convicted on the word of this caucasian german woman with no physical evidence to support her allegations.all the medical and scientific evidence supported my assertions that there was no sexual contact or encounter between this woman and myself. the entire claims of sexual assaults are made up and false!the law enforcement, the prosecution and my so-called defense lawyers all knew the complainant was lying because of the lack of any supporting evi­dence, which included a dna testing report that had been requested by the prosecution but withheld and hidden from myself and the jury during the time of trial. it was also hidden from me during my direct appeal by my so-called appellate lawyer and was not revealed to me until a grant of a motion for evidence in the state’s possession in the united states district court in <NUM>.it was then that i discovered that my trial defense lawyers and my appellate lawyers knew of this dna testing and had possession of the testing report, which is attached to the enclosed manuscript. these privately retained lawyers who were supposed to be representing me were actually in collusion with law enforcement to ensure i was placed back into prison, albeit falsely.since my reimprisonment i have been able to discover much more evidence which reveals that law enforcement and the riverside district attorney’s office knew all along that the complainant was lying about any sexual assault and only used the accuser to facilitate their vendetta and place me back into prison, since their plot to murder me didn’t work.i am seeking assistance and support from the public, especially the black community, as this continued persecution of me reflects the historic daily persecution and terrorism of black men and women in their daily lives all over this nation. the lapd detective team that framed chance and myself had a <NUM> percent conviction rate in the black community.it’s a shame that we don’t have a national black folks innocence project. we should have a national association for the advancement of black people, the naabp!i am seeking assistance and support from the public, especially the black community, as this continued persecution of me reflects the historic daily persecution and terrorism of black men and women in their daily lives all over this nation.i want to expose the systematic incarceration of black folks on trumped up charges for the purposes of economic gain from the lucrative business of legalized slavery in the penal colony to clearing society of unwanted blacks, especially the black man, as the rulers prepare to engage in the universal conflict known in the holy writings as armageddon!black people in this nation are in a very precarious position as an endanger­ed species, while many of us are not paying attention but distracted by crack and gangster rap, and our million dollar entertainers are spending their time and money on sport and play, refusing to invest in any viable in­dustry to benefit the national interests of black people such as food, shelter and clothing.soon the parable of the ant and the grasshopper

around <NUM> meters above the city and killed over <NUM>,<NUM>. while it did effectively end the second world war it was a huge price that japan is never willing to pay again.sadly, the commemoration was overshadowed by the threat that has been posed by north korea. last month, the north korean military tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles with major us cities like chicago within the range of attack. according to the japan times, around <NUM>,<NUM> people attended the ceremony and that included representatives from <NUM> nations.if any kind of nuclear bomb was dropped today it would cause much more damage than that of the hiroshima bomb combined with the one dropped on nagasaki. so far, japan has been the only country to endure a nuclear attack, but it changed the country forever. kazumi matsui during the ceremony mentioned above asked the central government during this time to help in making a treaty banning nuclear weapons.during his speech, matsui demanded that the government give more assistance and compassion to the elder hibakusha as well as the many others also suffering mentally and physically from the effects of radiation. the japan times reports that city officials claim the ‘many others’ reference was referring to people who were affected by the march <NUM> triple core meltdown at the fukushima no. <NUM> nuclear power plant.during the ceremony another japanese male, hiroshima native masaharu masuda offered a prayer for his parents who experienced the bombing, as he does every year. masuda says he is disappointed by the japanese government’s response to the nuclear ban treaty and worries that the world is losing interest in hiroshima’s message. with that being said, shinzo abe defends that decision by saying that a more realistic approach is needed in order to reach a goal of living in a world without nuclear weapons.the devastating events that occurred at hiroshima and nagasaki should never be forgotten and the message that comes with remembering should be shared world wide. this is something that can happen anywhere at anytime. we are not toys and our world leaders should not be playing god.how do you feel about all of this and

who flipped off trump’s motorcade was fired for her behaviorheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!the woman made infamous for flipping off president donald trump’s motorcade says she was fired from her job for her childish behavior. juli briskman said the marketing company bosses called her in and gave her the boot.but, nonetheless, the <NUM>-year-old says she has no regrets about flipping off the president’s motorcade. briskman was cycling in virginia last month when she offered the gesture in what she described as a “gut reaction” to donald trump’s policies. “he was passing by and my blood just started to boil,” she told the huffington post. “i’m thinking, daca (aka, “dreamers,” children of illegal immigrants who were allowed to stay in the united states) recipients are getting kicked out. he pulled ads for open enrollment in obamacare. only one-third of puerto rico has power. i’m thinking, he’s at the damn golf course again.”a photographer traveling with the presidential motorcade snapped briskman’s picture and the image quickly spread across news outlets and social media. many hailed briskman as a hero, with some saying she should run in the <NUM> election; while others called her disrespectful, emotionally driven, and childish.“i flipped off the motorcade a number of times,” briskman added. but her bosses didn’t find her little stunt all that entertaining, or in accordance with how the company perceives the manner in which an employee should conduct themselves in or out of the workplace.briskman had been working as a marketing and communications specialist for a virginia-based federal contractor, akima, for six months. she thought it best detail to the human resources department that she was now infamous for being emotionally unstable and flipping off the president. with all of the online fuss around her actions, the company would have likely found out about her antics anyway.bosses called her into a meeting after she ratted herself out, she said. “they said, ‘we’re separating from you,’” briskman told the huffington post. “‘basically, you cannot have lewd or obscene things in your social media.’ so they were calling flipping him off obscene.” unfortunately for briskman, that’s fairly common among companies. most want their employees to behave in a manner befitting the company (including on social media), and flipping off the president probably didn’t make akima look all that great. one would expect the exact same reaction from a boss should a person have been fired for flipping off president obama’s motorcade.she said the company was displeased she had used the image as her profile picture on twitter and facebook and the bosses told her that using the image violated social media policy and could hurt the company’s reputation as a government contractor. briskman said she pointed out that her social media pages do not mention her employer. she also tried to shift blame when she said another employee had written a profane insult about someone on facebook, but had been allowed to keep his job after deleting the post and being reprimanded. unfortunately, briskman cannot simply “delete” what she did considering the photo went viral; but it’s oddly amusing she tried to throw a fellow employee under the bus for her misdeeds.virginia, however, has “at will” employment laws, meaning private-sector employers can fire anyone for any reason. suddenly, the emotionally unstable <NUM>-year-old mother of two found herself looking for a new job. briskman, who votes democratic (big surprise), said she planned to look for a new job with an advocacy group she believes in, such as planned parenthood or people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta).that seems about right for a democrat. advocate for the slaughter of innocent human beings while saving all the animals.this article has been contributed by shtf plan. visit www.shtfplan.com for

hemp cultivation would be a boon for small farmers, especially organic farmers. i’m talking only about industrial hemp, not medical cannabis/marijuana, which continues to prove its merits and gain acceptance.industrial hemp’s use should be a no-brainer. but it’s a complex boondoggle of legal and bureaucratic nonsense even without thc, the molecule that leads to “reefer madness”.industrial hemp commercial cultivation is legal in canada. but the usa hemp industry was pushed to the side by government connected industry insiders whose monopolies were threatened when it appeared hemp may boom and compete for the very products of their monopolist concerns.circa <NUM>, the hemp industry had been given a mechanical invention gift known as the decoricator machine was invented. it was a machine that was to hemp what the <NUM>th century cotton gin was. it replaced hand shredding of hemp to glean its fibers, fibers that could be used for textiles, clothing, paper, and plastic.with the advent of the decoricator, hemp would have been able to take over competing industries in paper, textiles for clothing and other applications, fuel, and plastics. growing hemp in abundance was easy, and it’s plant to harvest time was no more than six months.according to popular mechanics during that time, “<NUM>,<NUM> acres devoted to hemp will produce as much paper as <NUM>,<NUM> acres of average [forest] pulp land.” then a small number of large businesses with competition concerns used high level government connections to push through the marijuana tax act of <NUM>.the ensuing marijuana scares hyped by movies such as “reefer madness” brought about more legislation that would prohibit all hemp cultivation, even hemp without thc.prior to this, even without the high speed decoricator, hemp was an easy cash crop for small farmers, some of whom were recruited to continue cultivating hemp during ww ii to provide hemp fibers for u.s. naval ships’ ropes as well as other military applications.and prior to that, hemp was so important during colonial and early american times that farmers were virtually required to cultivate it along with their other crops.george washington – “make the most you can of the indian hemp seed and sow it everywhere.”thomas jefferson – “hemp is of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country.”hemp for nutritionhulled hemp seeds, their powders and cold pressed oils provide all the essential amino acids for easily digested high protein. hemp is not only very high in omega-<NUM>, but it provides an almost perfect ratio of omega-<NUM> to omega-<NUM>.it is truly a super food that you can buy in health food stores or online. the seeds come from canada, where industrial hemp is legal. hemp is so nutritionally dense that one could survive on hemp seeds alone during extreme food shortages. if hemp were legal, you could easily grow your own.hemp improves farmingaquaponics hemp plants don’t need pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, which rely mostly on the phosphate industry. a phosphate industry byproduct is the sodium fluoride that is sold to municipality water works for our poisoned tap water.the runoff from fields of phosphate fertilizers into waterways that merge with seawater is causing all sorts of nitrogen and phosphorous excesses and imbalances, leading to algae that stifles the water’s ecological support systems.hemp’s thick roots ward off weeds, and growing hemp improves the soil’s nitrogen, making that soil better for other crops. they would be useful and lucrative rotation crops for organic farmers.hemp plants have a growth cycle of only four months. in mild climates, harvesting hemp two times in one year would create an annual cash cow for farmers. the marijuana taboo is eliminated by allowing the male plants to continually pollinate the female plants. this reduces psychotropic thc to legal levels.eliminating toxic petrochemical plasticsthere is a clump of plastic waste residue larger than the state of texas floating in the middle of the pacific. a lot of it is expected to decompose, creating a plastic soup in the ocean. the toxins from this plastic soup spread out into other oceanic regions and are hazardous to fish and bird wildlife. this soup could find its way into our kitchens as well!all kinds of plastics are produced with hemp, from clear wraps for foods to automobile parts. hemp plastics are durable and heat resistant. and they are bio-degradable. recently the french auto industry use hemp to manufacture some of its automobile parts. henry ford pioneered this in <NUM> when he built his “vegetable car” with hemp and flax. it was stronger and lighter than steel cars.ford’s hemp-mobile also used hemp bio-diesel fuel, which creates very little pollution. the petroleum industry didn’t want to see or hear that. hemp seeds were even used to make paints and lacquers in the mid-<NUM>s.petrochemical plastics for all purposes could be replaced with hemp plastics that are non-toxic and bio-degradable. bye-bye bpa!construction materials for housingamazingly, housing construction materials made from hemp fibers have been discovered to be superior to most cheap materials used in housing construction these days. ever see a house under construction after its initial framing?what you’ll usually see before whatever exterior coating is used are sheets of wood substitutes, either pasteboard or particle board or pressboards, some of which are processed and bound with toxic chemicals that can off-gas into interior quarters. it’s cheaper than other materials and used abundantly.inexpensive aquaponics hemp can be made into various different building materials, hempcrete, fiberboard, carpet, stucco, cement blocks, insulation, and plastic. those materials are stronger and much longer lasting than what’s being used currently. they are also mold and rot free and more fire resistant. and they are environmentally and ecologically friendly and non-toxic.more trees for tree huggerspulp from trees is used to make paper. but anything wood pulp can do, hemp fibers can do better. it’s said that the original constitution and bill of rights were on hemp paper.paper from trees can be recycled maybe three times. hemp paper can be recycled eight times. since hemp was effectively banned in the usa since <NUM>, <NUM>% of the usa’s forests have been eliminated. it takes years for trees to grow. hemp can be gown and harvested within six months.it’s estimated that one acre of hemp produces more oxygen from co<NUM> and methane than <NUM> acres of forest. one idea presented by hemp advocates is to have inner city hemp plots to improve urban air quality. we wouldn’t need bogus carbon tax legislation.pulping trees for paper creates more waste, pollution, and consumes more energy than most enterprises. this industry consumes more water than almost all others. it is the fifth largest industry consumer of energy, and it emits a good deal of toxicity in the process.“why use up the forests which were centuries in the making and the mines which required ages to lay down, if we can get the equivalent of forest and mineral products in the annual growth of the hemp fields?” — henry fordanything the petrochemical industry can produce, hemp can do better without toxic environmental and human consequences. deforesting could be a thing of the past if hemp became the major source of construction materials and paper. heavily pesticide and herbicide sprayed or gmo cotton wouldn’t be necessary, nor would toxic synthetic fibers.amazing how such an easily cultivated plant with so many beneficial applications has been so efficiently suppressed by the one or two percent for their purposes while too many among the <NUM>% agreed with that suppression.paul fassa is a contributing staff writer for realfarmacy.com. his pet peeves are the medical mafia’s control over health and the food industry and government regulatory

in right doses completely reverses depression: breakthrough study% of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents.headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!magnesium is already known by many as a tremendous booster of health. it contributes to sound sleep, helps with digestion and constipation, relieves muscle aches, and even improves heart health and migraine headaches – but here’s a shocker: magnesium in small doses leads to an astonishing reversal of depression.what is magnesium and why do we need it?magnesium is one of the most important elements in the human body. it is a micronutrient and mineral that is involved in thousands of biochemical processes crucial for the proper functioning of the cardiovascular, alimentary, endocrine, and osteoarticular systems, but oddly, it seems absolutely vital to regulating our mood and levels of happiness.in a breakthrough study conducted by researchers at the larner college of medicine at the university of vermont and published in plos one has found that just <NUM>mg of magnesium per day leads to an about-face of depression symptoms in study subjects.“new clinical research results show magnesium is effective at addressing symptoms and is safer and easier on the wallet than prescription therapies,” reports science daily.mounds of research proving we need magnesium to combat depressionresearch of this kind regarding magnesium isn’t new, but it stands to reinforce what nutritionists, health coaches, and even some psychologists have been stating for decades.another study states this about magnesium and depression:“anxiety related conditions are the most common affective disorders present in the general population with a lifetime prevalence of over <NUM>%. magnesium (mg) status is associated with subjective anxiety, leading to the proposition that mg supplementation may attenuate anxiety symptoms.”and this study explains that:“after adjusting for all potential confounders, the strength of the association of very low magnesium intake with depression was statistically significant (rr = <NUM>.<NUM>; <NUM>% ci, <NUM>.<NUM>-<NUM>.<NUM>).”or how about this study which states that the daily consumption of <NUM> mg magnesium:“. . . tablets for ≥<NUM> wk by depressed patients suffering from magnesium deficiency leads to improvements in depression status and magnesium levels.”so, while not all the studies agree on the exact amount of magnesium that we need each day to combat depression, they repeat over and over in hundreds of additional studies, that depleted magnesium levels contribute to depression.why we’re all magnesium deficientdepleted soilwhy are so many of us magnesium deficient, aside from the fact that many vital micronutrients and minerals we need have been raped from the soil via industrial farming practices, and by adding non-organic, toxic chemical fertilizers and herbicides to the very soil which must grow our food?too much sugarwe also eat too much sugar. is this a coincidence? the sugar industry has been hiding the effects of sugar on us for decades – and one of those effects is that sugar eats up our magnesium stores.refined sugar causes you to waste most vitamin and minerals in the body, mainly b-vitamins, potassium, magnesium, zinc and manganese. sugar raises co<NUM> levels in the blood, which causes you to go to bicarbonate stores which buffer it, causing a depletion of minerals like magnesium.stressanother culprit is stress – both mental and physical stress, with its related continuous flow of adrenaline, uses up our magnesium stores rapidly. adrenaline affects heart rate, blood pressure, vascular constriction and muscle contraction— actions that all demand steady supplies of magnesium for smooth function, and without it you can guess what happens.we also require magnesium to create serotonin, one of the “happy hormones” which prevents depression. stress causes less serotonin to be created, and replaces it with cortisol and other stress hormones. stress and depression are inextricably linked. without enough magnesium we haven’t got a chance at fighting depression naturally.detoxificationmagnesium is a powerful detoxifier. it removes everything from heavy metals, to glyphosate and other herbicides from our bodies, as well as thousands of environmental toxins and metabolic toxins. if we become overly toxic, due to a lack of magnesium, we are more likely be depressed as the brain suffers from inflammation it cannot overcome.is it any wonder we suffer from the following additional diseases, aside from depression, all of which are linked to magnesium deficiency?gastrointestinal disorders: prolonged diarrhea, crohn’s disease, malabsorption syndromes, celiac disease, surgical removal of a portion of the intestine, and intestinal inflammation due to radiation may all lead to magnesium depletion.renal disorders (magnesium wasting): diabetes mellitus and long-term use of certain diuretics (see drug interactions) may result in increased urinary loss of magnesium. multiple other medications can also result in renal magnesium wasting.chronic alcoholism: poor dietary intake, gastrointestinal problems, and increased urinary loss of magnesium may all contribute to magnesium depletion, which is frequently encountered in alcoholics.age: several studies have found that elderly people have relatively low dietary intakes of magnesium. intestinal magnesium absorption tends to decrease with age and urinary magnesium excretion tends to increase with age; thus, suboptimal dietary magnesium intake may increase the risk of magnesium depletion in the elderly.how much magnesium do i need and where can i get it?so how much magnesium should you take? general dosage recommendations range from about <NUM> to <NUM> milligrams per pound of body weight. experiment with a supplement and you’ll know exactly how much you need.you can also consume natural sources of magnesium which can be found in foods like:spinachchardalmondsgreek yogurtblack beansavocadocoriandersalmonpumpkin seedsyogurt or kefirfigsdark chocolatebananacashewsgoat

doanwhen he traveled to china for a state visit in october <NUM>, philippine president rodrigo duterte was grandly received by beijing.nguyen phu trong, general secretary of the communist party of vietnam (cpv), was treated much in the same manner during his official trip to china last week.yet, while mr trong’s visit was aimed at developing stronger ties with china, it does not mean that the communist leadership in hanoi is pursuing a duterte-like pivot to beijing.closer ties with beijingtrong’s four-day trip, which started on january <NUM>, was his first to china since being re-elected as the cpv’s leader at its <NUM>th national congress in january <NUM> and his first foreign tour in <NUM>.he went to beijing with a high-ranking delegation that included four politburo members in charge of four important departments in vietnam’s one-party regime – namely central propaganda, foreign affairs, national defense and public security.during the visit, hanoi and beijing reached a wide range of agreements aimed at strengthening cooperation between the two ruling parties and the two communist neighbors in various fields and at many levels.trong’s outing was followed by recent notable trips to the asian juggernaut by other vietnamese top officials – including prime minister nguyen xuan phuc and dinh the huynh, the cpv’s permanent secretary, in september and october <NUM>, respectively. mr huynh, an influential politburo member, is tipped to succeed trong if the <NUM>-year old leader chooses to step down in the near future.all these journeys suggest hanoi is attaching a greater importance to its cooperation with beijing and adopting a more friendly posture toward the latter than about six or seven months ago. a combination of factor may contribute to this change.one of these is the fact that china is vietnam’s closest neighbor, sharing not only land and sea borders but also many political and economic similarities with the former. the world’s most populous country is also vietnam’s biggest trading partner. given all of these, coupled with vietnam’s power asymmetry vis-à-vis its giant neighbor, for the country’s stability – and perhaps for the cpv’s survival – steadying its ties with beijing is always a priority for hanoi.chinese leaders’ current charm diplomacy is also influencing hanoi’s posture. mr trong was the first foreign leader china received in <NUM>. he was given a red-carpet welcome upon his arrival at the beijing international airport and an official welcoming ceremony with full honors at the great hall of the people in beijing on january <NUM>. five of the seven members of the all-powerful standing committee of the politburo of the communist party of china (cpc), including president xi jinping and premier li keqiang, held talks with him.mr phuc was given a similar treatment when he toured china last september.the warm reception chinese leaders extended to their vietnamese “comrades and brothers” indicates that beijing is also highly valuing hanoi and its relations with the latter. this, in return, is increasing vietnam’s trust – or at least, decreasing its mistrust – in beijing and encouraging it to develop tighter ties with china.it seems tensions and suspicion caused by china’s actions in recent years, notably its placement of its huge oil rig, hs-<NUM>, in vietnam’s exclusive economic zone in <NUM>, have now eased.overt overtures made toward beijing by several regional countries, particularly malaysia and the philippines, are another defining factor.last november, malaysian prime minster najib razak made a six-day trip to china. during that visit, which was intended to elevate their relationship to “greater heights”, kuala lumpur and beijing signed many new agreements, including malaysia’s first major defense deal with china.two weeks before that, president rodrigo duterte also made a landmark trip to beijing, where he eventually and solemnly announced his “separation from the us” and his “dependence” on china, after months of publicly denouncing washington and praising beijing.malaysia’s turn toward beijing and especially the philippines’ dramatic tilt away from its long-standing and most important ally to china’s orbit somehow influenced a rethink in hanoi.like vietnam, malaysia and the philippines have outstanding territorial disputes with china in the south china sea. for years, they were among the region’s most vocal critics of their northern neighbor’s expansive claims and aggressive actions in this resource-rich and strategically vital water. they all favored multilateral approaches to the maritime disputes. hanoi supported the philippines’s south china sea arbitration and welcomed its landmark legal victory against china last july.duterte’s wholehearted embrace of china, which resulted in his side-lining of the july ruling and agreeing to enter bilateral talks with beijing prompted vietnam to soften its posture and improve relations with china.last but not least, donald trump’s shock rise to the american presidency is also a key reason behind hanoi’s current accommodating posture toward beijing.under the obama administration, vietnam and america edged remarkably closer to each other. their stronger ties were strengthened by – and manifested in – many key developments and agreements. prominent among these are mr trong’s unprecedented trip to washington in <NUM>, president obama’s milestone visit to vietnam in <NUM>, during which he officially ended america’s decades-old arms embargo on its former war foe, and vietnam’s enthusiastic response to america’s asia pivot and the us-led tpp.vietnam’s strong economic and strategic ties with the us have been in jeopardy following trump’s election victory. faced with the imminent collapse of the tpp and other uncertainties about america’s relations with asia and vietnam under trump, hanoi is relatively readjusting its foreign policy and improving its ties with beijing can be seen as part of such recalibration.but not a duterte-like shiftyet, while becoming more receptive to beijing, hanoi is not bandwagoning with the latter; and this is because of many reasons.one of these concerns vietnam’s economic imbalance with china. though it has dropped recently, vietnam’s trade deficit with the world’s second biggest economy remains enormous. according to its general statistics office (gso), in <NUM>, vietnam exported (us)$<NUM>.<NUM> billion in goods to the world’s largest trading country and imported $<NUM>.<NUM> billion from it. this means it had a trade deficit of $<NUM> billion with china last year.for years, hanoi has asked beijing to help balance the bilateral trade by creating better conditions for vietnamese goods to enter the chinese market. it is reported that in his talk with nguyen phu trong, xi jinping promised that china will work harder to make the two countries’ trade relations grow faster and become more balanced.whether vietnam’s companies and their goods are provided with a greater access to china following trong’s visit remains to be seen. yet, in any case, it will take years or decades, if ever, for vietnam to balance its trade with china. for this reason – and in order to avoid economic overdependence on its giant neighbor and to sustain its economic development – vietnam needs good relations with its other major trading partners, notably the european union and the us, with which it has enjoyed a huge trade surplus in recent years. in <NUM>, vietnam exported us$<NUM> billion (in goods) to the eu, its third largest trading partner, and us$<NUM>.<NUM> billion to the us.as america is vietnam’s biggest export market and second largest trader, while it is unclear how donald trump will view and approach his country’s relations with vietnam, it is certain that hanoi will try its best to sustain and improve its ties with washington.another reason why vietnam is seeking better relations with the us and other powers, including japan and india, is its unresolved maritime disputes with china.during trong’s china visit, both sides pledged to manage maritime differences and avoid any acts that may complicate the situation and escalate tensions in the south china sea. nevertheless, after “candidly” exchanging their views on issue, they could not yet accept each other’s main position.according to a report by the vov, vietnam’s national radio broadcaster, in his talk with his chinese counterpart, trong “asserted vietnam’s consistent stance of persistently dealing with the dispute in the east sea [vietnam’s name for the south china sea] by peaceful measures in compliance with international law, including the <NUM> united nations convention on the law of the sea (unclos), and with respect to diplomatic and legal processes.”in contrast, as manifested by its vehement objection to the philippines’ arbitration case, beijing has stringently opposed any legal approach to resolve the disputes. instead, it has forcibly insisted on bilateral negotiations.their joint communique mentioned neither of these two positions.given china’s expansive claims and its past and recent actions in the south china sea, vietnam does not expect – though it strongly hopes – that beijing will willingly accept a peaceful solution to the dispute based on the principles of international law, including unclos. that is why it has hedged – and continues to hedge – against any aggressive move by china by forging strong ties with global and regional powers, notably those that are also concerned about beijing’s hegemonic ambitions.this is supported by the fact that whilst trong was holding talks with chinese leaders in beijing, in hanoi nguyen xuan phuc received john kerry. the latter’s visit might not have a major impact on future us-vietnam cooperation. yet, in his talk with the outgoing us secretary of state, the vietnamese premier expressed his delight at achievements in us-vietnam relations and vietnam’s desire to reinforce bilateral ties. this shows the vietnamese leadership really values its relationship with washington.just a day after trong returned from china, hanoi received shinzo abe. in their separate meetings with the japanese prime minister, the southeast asian country’s top four leaders – party chief, state president, prime minister and parliament chairwoman – all affirmed hanoi’s desire to deepen economic and strategic ties with japan. for his part, during this two-day visit, mr abe pledged to provide vietnam with six new coastguard patrols. the patrol vessels, worth $<NUM> million, were part of the $<NUM>-billion loan tokyo offered hanoi.vietnam-japan relations have significantly advanced in recent years and this is mainly due to their shared concerns over china’s maritime ambitions and actions.such apprehensions have also brought vietnam closer to india, china’s other key regional rival. six months ago, before phuc’s china trip, hanoi hosted prime minister narendra modi. during that landmark visit, the first official trip to vietnam by an indian prime minister since <NUM>, the two countries elevated their “strategic partnership” to “comprehensive strategic partnership” and new delhi agreed to provide vietnam with a $<NUM> million defense loan.all of these demonstrate that while it may prioritize relations with beijing, hanoi is also seeking stronger ties with other powers, notably the us, japan and india, to counterbalance china, both economically and strategically. it is also evident that the vietnamese leadership is not overtly leaning toward beijing and submitting to the latter’s maritime position as president duterte has done.following duterte’s china visit last october, during which he publicly promised to shift his country’s allegiance from washington to beijing, some international relations experts, notably those from china, predicted that america’s other asian partners, such as vietnam, may follow suit.ahead of trong’s visit last week, an article in the global times, a spin-off of the people’s daily, the cpc’s mouthpiece, also suggested that the shift in diplomacy by the philippine leader “sets a good example for the other southeast asian countries, including vietnam.”judging by mr trong’s assertion of vietnam’s maritime position in his talk with the chinese leader and other diplomatic and strategic moves recently taken by hanoi, it is apparent that vietnamese leaders are not following mr duterte’s steps or “example”.instead, they remain firmly committed to their long-held foreign policy of independence, diversification and multilateralization that has enabled vietnam to develop good – and generally fruitful – relations with many countries, including all the world’s major powers and the region’s countries.atimes.com",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,is vietnam tilting toward

explosive details revealed in fusion gps co-founder’s testimony transcript% of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents.headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!this week, the house intelligence committee agreed to release the transcripts from the november <NUM>, <NUM> testimony of glenn simpson, co-founder of fusion gps.fusion gps, as we all know, is the research firm employed to gather research on donald trump during the <NUM> election cycle – first by conservative news site, the washington free beacon, and then picked up by the clinton campaign.there’s been a lot of controversy surrounding the dossier produced through those efforts. some details have been proven, some disproved, and others remain unsubstantiated.whatever the case, republican lawmakers insist an unsubstantiated dossier was the sole impetus for the ongoing probe into russian interference in the <NUM> election, as well as possible collusion by trump’s team, and they want the investigation shut down.democrats, predictably, want to push further, desperate to prove that they didn’t make a bad decision by installing hillary clinton as their hand-picked candidate for the presidency.then there are those who are standing in between, with suspicions, and maybe some doubts, but who ultimately want to hear everything and get to the truth.that would be where i’m at, actually.and speaking of everything, what do the released transcripts of simpson’s testimony reveal?keeping in mind that this was simpson speaking about what his firm suspected, the transcripts show that there was suspicions of something beyond just an election.“those transcripts reveal serious allegations that the trump organization may have engaged in money laundering with russian nationals,” representative adam schiff said.may have.and honestly, the rumors of trump and his organization being neck-deep in dealings with the russian mob have been around for years. these aren’t campaign-generated accusations. talk to longtime residents of new york and new jersey and you get the impression that it’s a badly kept secret.so what brought simpson and his company to suspect such nefarious activities?in his testimony, simpson said that his firm closely examined sales of condominiums in trump properties in new york, miami, panama city and toronto. “there were a lot of real estate deals where you couldn’t really tell who was buying the property,” simpson said. “and sometimes properties would be bought and sold, and they would be bought for one price and sold for a loss shortly thereafter, and it really didn’t make sense to us.” “we saw patterns of buying and selling that we thought were suggestive of money-laundering,” he continued.the trump organization’s chief counsel, alan garten, claims that the properties referenced by simpson were simply properties trump had licensed his name to, rather than having any substantial interest in.“these accusations are completely reckless and unsubstantiated for a multitude of reasons,” garten said. “these issues have nothing to do with the scope of the investigation” by the house intelligence committee, garten said in a phone interview. “but it’s not surprising the minority (democrats) would focus on this given they’ve found absolutely no evidence of collusion.”he’s not wrong. i don’t think the ongoing russia probe was meant to target potential criminal activity, such as money laundering. i do believe, however, that if money laundering or any other criminal activity is swept up in the ongoing investigation, it could certainly go to motive.simpson’s testimony also revealed suspicions that russia sought to infiltrate u.s. politics through powerful lobbies, such as the national rifle association.i mentioned that situation earlier this week.they also attempted to influence groups that promote independence for texas and california.“they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the nra,” simpson said, according to the transcript.so where do we go from here, given this information?we keep digging.this shouldn’t be considered a partisan issue. it should raise enough concerns that responsible american citizens want to know everything, before making a decision.the post potentially explosive details revealed in fusion gps co-founder’s testimony transcript

service. he wrote a new book. it’s called plunder and deceit: big government’s exploitation of young people and the future.as an investigative author, i spend my time combing through troves of data, reams of financial transactions, and stacks of inter-governmental communiqués, all in an effort to unearth fact-patterns of self-dealing and cronyism, malfeasance and graft. my work is zoomed in, specific, granular.the conservative movement needs its sleuths. but what i love about levin’s plunder and deceit is its philosophical breadth and panoramic sweep. powered by intellectual titans like edmund burke, alexis de tocqueville, and james madison, levin urges young people to embark upon the creation of a “new civil rights movement,” one that snaps the manacles of statist power and embraces an intellectual and economic freedom that excites and animates the moral imagination.best of all, levin respects young readers enough to shoot straight with them: the road to serfdom is breezy; the march to liberty painstaking. yet, as he reminds us, the fruits of the latter far eclipse the former.“it is the nature of younger people today to passively live and let live and conform to their second-class standing; or worse, if inspired, to unite around distractive or self-destructive causes,” writes levin. “but the right cause now is nothing short of self-preservation. and there can be no doubt that the new civil rights movement and new generation of activists, which must challenge the tyranny of the status quo, will be met with entrenched resistance, resulting in unease, discomfiture, risk, and ridicule. this is a small price to pay for freedom and justice.”amen!with the constitution always as his guide, levin explains to “the rising generation” why the nation’s founding bedrock document is precious and rare. as president ronald reagan put it, in the constitutions of most governments, “the government tells the people of those countries what they’re allowed to do. in our constitution, ‘we the people’ tell the government what it can do.”that’s a difference worth fighting for and protecting. levin’s book shows us how.authentic, sagacious, and written in a philosophical tenor that sometimes soars to operatic heights, plunder and deceit is an important work to be read by all and bequeathed to america’s rising generation.",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE>

time since the end of the cold war, nato is expanding its command structure. a plan to establish two new military headquarters designed to improve the movement of troops across the atlantic and within europe to counter russia was endorsed at the november <NUM>-<NUM> meeting of nato defense ministers in brussels. one of the planned new nato command centers will be tasked with ensuring the security of ""sea lines of communication"" between north america and europe. the other command will ""improve the movement of military forces across europe"" and strengthen logistical functions across nato. military commanders would ""flesh out the details"" and present them to defense ministers in february <NUM>.""this is not only about commands,"" said secretary general jens stoltenberg. according to him, it is vital that european roads, bridges and rail networks are able to carry tanks and heavy military equipment. ""we are now much more focused on moving heavy equipment across europe,"" he explained.the locations are due to be chosen next year. germany has expressed interest in hosting the logistics base. portugal, spain, france, and the united states could be potential hosts for the new atlantic command. the ministers also agreed on the creation of a new cyberoperations center to strengthen cyberdefenses and help integrate cybercapabilities into nato planning and operations at all levels.nato nations deployed about <NUM>,<NUM> troops this year across estonia, latvia and lithuania, and poland – the alliance members which share borders with russia.the nato event coincided in time with the united states house and senate armed services committees’ approval (nov.<NUM>) of the national defense authorization act (ndaa) for fiscal year <NUM>. the ndaa supports a topline of $<NUM> billion for national defense—a $<NUM> billion increase above the president’s combined initial and amended budget requests. the ndaa also authorizes $<NUM>.<NUM> billion for the european deterrence initiative (edi) to boost military capability to counter russia, including accelerating procurement of army prepositioned equipment and munitions stocks in europe. the bill limits military-to-military cooperation with moscow.the legislation authorizes $<NUM> million to provide security assistance to ukraine, including defensive lethal weapons. $<NUM> million will be spent on military aid to the baltic states.the bill includes the allocation of $<NUM> million to counter russia’s alleged non-compliance with the intermediate-range nuclear forces (inf) treaty, including a research and development program on a ground-launched intermediate-range missile, “which would not place the united states in violation of the treaty.” section <NUM> of ndaa allows the pentagon to establish “a research and development program for a dual-capable road-mobile ground-launched missile system with a maximum range of <NUM>,<NUM> kilometers.” this is the first step to jettison the treaty. true, the development of a ground-based mid-range missile is not yet a violation but rather a demonstration of intent to do so. but once allocated, money cannot be wasted.the deployment of nato ground-based nuclear-tipped intermediate forces in the old continent is a european problem as nato allies will become targets for russia’s retaliatory strikes. then why should the us tackle it if europeans don’t ask it to do so? after all, the pretext for development of the missile is the need to defend european allies but no european nato member has asked the us for protection. why should the us take the initiative into its hands without european nuclear powers, such as the uk and france, participating in the program? perhaps, the situation when europeans fully depend on the us to protect them from “russia’s nuclear threat” serves the american interests boosting washington’s influence over european affairs.with the inf treaty effective no more, moscow will be free to deploy intermediate-range missiles without restriction. no european nato member has given consent to have the weapons on its territory. the decision to develop a ground-based mid-range missile may spark a backlash from european allies. the deployment of us intermediate-range weapons on the old continent will hit them in the same way the extension of american sanctions on european energy companies runs counter to their economic interests.the fact that the ndaa authorizes the development of the weapon banned by the treaty will inevitably impact russia’s military planning.true, russia and the us have problems with the inf treaty. each side accuses the other of non-compliance at the time the general state of the bilateral relations hinders the attempts to find common language on any issue. expanding the european deterrence initiative is also not the best way to ease tensions with russia.despite that, opportunities offered by the special verification commission (svc) envisioned by the inf treaty are far from being exhausted. the parties could use the svc venue to consider additional confidence-building measures and information exchanges. contemporary technical means of verification make violations impossible to conceal. evidence can be presented and differences can be ironed out. but, if signed by president as it is, the ndaa will include first practical steps to tear up the inf treaty.the violation of the treaty will negatively affect the prospects for strategic offensive forces (sof) control. the inf and new start are the only two remaining nuclear arms control treaties in force. the capability of the us to knock out elements of command and control structure as well as at least some ground-based russian strategic nuclear assets from europe without using its intercontinental capability will influence the balance of sof. one thing will lead to another eroding the entire nuclear arms control regime. looks like the views of heritage foundation calling for withdrawal from the treaty prevail in the us congress.the nato defense chiefs and us lawmakers have just

the newest middle ages?the process already taking shape in the world of consolidating «larger spaces», and the return of the empires of by-gone eras may not, at first glance, seem to respond to the spirit of the times. however, we are living in an age which, in view of its uncertainty in people's minds, is indiscriminate to such an extent that it is no stranger to the most improbable policy prescriptions.the world is in a state of interregnum in which, as zygmunt bauman says, «change is the only constant, and the unknown - the only certainty»; in this world, europe remains a battlefield, but nowadays the battle is between a westphalian model of sovereign states and new forms of supranational governance…traditional european empires of modern times, which is to say the modern age, have risen up on the ruins of feudalism. however, it is a peculiarity of postmodernism that it is ready, on a fairly eclectic basis, to take on the organisational forms of political relations of any era. piracy, which was once from times of old (remember the famous algerian pirates) is today once again firmly establishing itself along the shores of africa; a by-effect, of course, but it has become indicative of a time in which the archaic and the modern intermingle in the most unimaginable way possible.this is nothing new, however. similar era breakdowns have taken place time and again. the russian philosopher nikolai berdyaev, in his work written between the two world wars entitled «the new middle ages», wrote: «we are destined to live in a historical time of era change». berdyaev referred to this time as «the end of new history and the beginning of a new middle ages», defining it as a transition from the rationalism of new history to the irrationalism of a medieval type... «the spiritual beginnings of past history are being eliminated, its spiritual power exhausted... all the usual categories of thought and form of life of the most «advanced», «progressive», even «revolutionary» people of the <NUM>th and <NUM>th centuries are hopelessly outdated and have lost all meaning for the present and especially for the future».according to berdyaev's observations, the transition to a new middle ages, just the same as the previous transition to an «old» middle ages, is accompanied by a noticeable expansion of old societies and the indiscernible addition of new ones. «individualism has eliminated all of its possibilities in new history, there is no longer any energy left in it... the end of the spirit of individualism is the end of new history... liberalism, democracy, parliamentarianism, constitutionalism, legal formalism, humanitarian morals, rationalist and empirical philosophy are all the offspring of an individualistic spirit, of a humanitarian self-assertiveness, and they are all dying away, they are all losing their former importance... is there much that is ontologically real about stock exchanges, banks and money, about monstrous factories producing useless objects or weapons for destroying life, about superficial luxuries, speeches by parliamentarians and lawyers, about newspaper articles? is there much that is real about the growth of insatiable demands?» the russian philosopher noted that christianity had previously played a unifying role for at least a substantial proportion of mankind. its very existence «signified an escape from pagan nationalism and particularism». at the end of new history, «we are once again seeing before us an unfettered world of pagan particularism, inside which there is a deadly battle and destruction taking place».however, many of berdyaev's ideas do not seem to be so pertinent these days; it would obviously be wrong to place an equals sign between the time in which he wrote and the beginning of the <NUM>st century. although the turns of the historical spiral are linked with each other, each one is also unique, and since the new middle ages has already taken place, then in imitation of berdyaev it might be possible to call the trend of our times the newest middle ages.one of the most noticeable features of this period, for example, is the emergence of various complex networks, and not just networks of an information-technology and sociological nature, but also those encompassing relations between states. strategies for using network warfare to control nations are extremely popular in washington. the pentagon, in particular, has officially adopted a new military doctrine of net-centric warfare aimed at «superior knowledge» and «information dominance». (<NUM>) at the same time, our internationally-networked world with its apparent independence of individual centres of power which are, in fact, incorporated into more complex hierarchical relations and interdependencies surprisingly reminds one, in an ontological sense, of the world of the middle ages.in particular, a system of multilayered vassalage is forming before our very eyes in which there will no longer be a supreme «liege lord» as before (because he cannot and does not want to do it), interfering in literally everything to do with the rulers in his area of dominance on the principle of «a vassal of my vassal is not my vassal». washington understands that it is both financially and physically impossible to delve into the particulars of all <NUM> world powers, but that is exactly what they have been trying to do there so far and with increasing amounts of effort. it is simpler to choose half a dozen or a dozen trusted agents («vassals») and entrust/trust them to do it, controlling them themselves. this is why some of the recent actions of america's close allies, first and foremost france, are so similar to the principle of distributing feudal lands. it is probably possible to talk about a plan for a kind of super empire in place of a sole super power which, on the basis of the network principle, would be subordinate to the regional or traditional empires currently acquiring a new lease of life. the centre would be the same, but now it would be more like a coordinator than a straight omnipresent steward; it would be considerably more economical and consequently, or so the americans are hoping, no less efficient. full sovereignty, meanwhile, including the right to military intervention, would undoubtedly be centred at the top of this pyramid. as the well-known american academic noam chomsky writes, the principles of international order lie in the fact that the united states has the right to use violence whenever they like. and nobody else has that right . «of course not. well, maybe our clients do. so they inherit the right. other american clients do, too. but the rights really reside in washington. that's what it means to own the world. it's like the air you breathe. you can't question it». (<NUM>)in fact today, on a new turn of history, a neofeudal system of vassal dependence is re-establishing itself in the world which, in its day, replaced the mighty rome. today's rome is washington, which in many ways is in exactly the same state of imperial exhaustion, including moral, and which in reality is trying to continue its hegemony using exactly the same methods, although with the very latest technology; but really it makes no different, it is only technique and there is nothing new in that.neo-vassalage has a lot of benefits. firstly, if something is going wrong, it is always possible to make it seem like the one responsible is not who is really pulling the strings, namely washington, but the vassal state. using this vassal, it is completely possible to deny one's own involvement in the fates of other states and pull on the robes of impartial arbitrator. secondly, such a mechanism for projecting global power also allows for the costs of managing territories to be kept to a minimum, which is rather important given the global financial crisis. at the same time, while setting about reorganising the world, washington also needs to factor in the costs that this would bring. at some point, the interests of the main liege lord may not coincide with the interests of large vassals capable of obstinacy. furthermore, those against whom this game is being directed may be in a position to set about strengthening their own alliances, the contours of which are already discernible. consequently, while on the way to putting its plan into action, washington still has a number of complex problems to solve.(to be continued)(<NUM>) burgess, kennet j. organizing for irregular warfare: implications for the brigade combatteam. nаval postgdaduate school. monterey,

professors berate and attack a teacher for showing a debate about non-gendered pronouns% of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents.headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!two neo-marxist professors at wilfrid laurier university in canada were recorded berating a young female teaching assistant for showing her first-year communications students a debate where professor jordan peterson argued against the use of non-gendered pronouns.teaching assistant lindsay shepherd can be heard breaking down into tears as her supervising professor nathan rambukkan and another professor, herbert pimlott, accuse her of creating a “toxic” and “problematic” environment which constitutes violence against transgendered students.here’s the audio from the national post:full tape:here’s some highlights:<NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM> “these arguments are counter to the canadian human rights code” rambukkana: …[peterson] lectures about critiquing feminism, critiquing trans rights — shepherd: i’m familiar. i follow him. but can you shield people from those ideas? am i supposed to comfort them and make sure that they are insulated away from this? like, is that what the point of this is? because to me, that is so against what a university is about. so against it. i was not taking sides. i was presenting both arguments. rambukkana: so the thing about this is, if you’re presenting something like this, you have to think about the kind of teaching climate that you’re creating. and this is actually, these arguments are counter to the canadian human rights code. even since … c-<NUM>, ever since this passed, it is discriminatory to be targeting someone due to their gender identity or gender expression. by c-<NUM>, rambukkana is referring to a recently passed federal bill that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity or expression. his read of it is dead wrong; it’s obviously not a violation of c-<NUM> to screen a tvontario program at a university. for one thing, the bill only applies to federally-regulated industries, which does not include universities. even if it did, legal experts contacted by the national post were extremely dubious that shepherd’s actions constituted anything remotely resembling discrimination. <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM> “it has created a toxic climate for some of the students” shepherd:like i said, it was in the spirit of debate. rambukkana: okay, “in the spirit of the debate” is slightly different than ‘this is a problematic idea that we might want to unpack.’ shepherd: but that’s taking sides. rambukkana: yes. shepherd: it’s taking sides for me to be like “oh, look at this guy, like everything that comes out of his mouth is b.s. but we’re going to watch anyway.” rambukkana: i understand the position that you’re coming from and your positionality, but the reality is that it has created a toxic climate for some of the students, you know, it’s great — shepherd: how many? who? how many? one? rambukkana: may i speak? shepherd: i have no concept of how many people complained, what their complaint was, you haven’t shown me the complaint. rambukkana: i understand that this is upsetting, but also confidentiality matters. shepherd: the number of people is confidential? rambukkana: yes.he understands her “positionality.”these lunatics belong in mental institutions, not universities.wilfrid laurier university president and vice chancellor deborah maclatchy issued an apology to shepherd after the story went viral.shepherd questioned maclatchy’s sincerity and said if she’s serious about protecting free speech she should adopt the university of chicago’s policies which say “being offended” or “triggered” is “not enough to suppress or silence debate.”this article has been contributed

demands doj turn over evidence related to obama-hezbollah drug trafficking% of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents.headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!congress has demanded that the department of justice turn over all documents related to a disturbing report from politico that the obama administration quashed a massive dea investigation into a $<NUM> million per month drug trafficking and money laundering scheme on u.s. soil which was directly funding hezbollah’s various terror campaigns around the world.“add this to the long list of concessions the obama administration made in pursuit of the nuclear agreement with iran,” said the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record about the matter. “the difference here is that this wasn’t just bad policy—it was potentially criminal. congress absolutely has a responsibility to get to the bottom of this.”the letter follows a commitment made by congressional leaders to open an investigation into the explosive claims of what is being described as a “potentially criminal” enterprise described to the free beacon by a congressional source as an offshoot of obama’s nuclear agreement with iran which saw $<NUM>.<NUM> billion dollars of euros, swiss francs and other currencies shipped directly to tehran on wooden pallets.in early <NUM>, french police smashed a hezbollah cell accused of trafficking cocaine for one of the world’s most ruthless drug cartels in order to fund the militant group’s operations in syria. the telegraph reported at the time:the agents, arrested in france, allegedly masterminded a massive global drug ring which raised millions of dollars to arm hizbollah gunmen fighting for bashar al-assad, the syrian president, in syria. two years ago, one of the outfit’s sicarios, or hitmen, was arrested in spain on suspicion of having ordered up to <NUM> murders worldwide. the hizbollah agents detained by french police include alleged leaders of the group’s european cell, including <NUM>-year-old businessman mohamad noureddine. the dea, which has classified him as a “specially-designated global terrorist”, accuses him of being a lebanese money launderer for hizbollah’s financial arm. a dea statement said: “these proceeds are used to purchase weapons for hizbollah for its activities in syria. this ongoing investigation…once again highlights the dangerous global nexus between drug trafficking and terrorism.”despite the active and ongoing dea investigations into hezbollah’s global operations, the obama administration “threw an increasingly insurmountable series of roadblocks in its way” according to politico.in a thursday letter from reps. jim jordan (r-oh) and ron desantis (r-fl) and obtained by the washington free beacon, congress demanded all communications and documents related to the dea’s “project cassandra” campaign which targeted “a global hizbollah network responsible for the movement of large quantities of cocaine in the united states and europe,” along with information on operations “titan” and “perseus,” as well as the lebanese canadian bank, the iran-hezbollah super facilitator initiative, and several named individuals.also sought are “all documents and communications referring or relating to the potential designation of hezbollah as a transnational criminal organization,” along with “all documents referring or relating to efforts to prosecute targets related to hezbolah” via the rico act.“we have a responsibility to evaluate whether these allegations are true, and if so, did the administration undermine u.s. law enforcement and compromise u.s. national security,” the lawmakers wrote to attorney general jeff sessions sessions.as the free beacon reported yesterday:u.s. drug enforcement agents who spoke to politico about the matter accused the obama administration of intentionally derailing an investigation into hezbollah’s drug trafficking and money laundering efforts that began in <NUM> under the bush administration. the investigation centered on hezbollah and iranian-backed militants who allegedly participated in the illicit drug network, which was subject to u.s. wiretaps and undercover operations. hezbollah is believed to have been laundering at least $<NUM> million a month just in the united states, according to the report. when u.s. authorities were ready to make the case against hezbollah’s most senior leadership, obama administration officials allegedly “threw an increasingly insurmountable series of roadblocks in its way,” according inside sources who spoke to politico about the situation the obama-led effort to block the investigation was “a policy decision, it was a systematic decision,” one source said. “they serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down.”as we reported yesterday, representative peter roskam (r-il), a chief national security voice in the house who fought against the nuclear accord, mimicked the views of desantis saying that congress must investigate the obama administration’s actions and work to increase pressure on hezbollah.“the report alleging the obama administration turned a blind eye and allowed hezbollah to pump drugs into the united states to fund its terror campaigns in the middle east is not surprising,” roskam said. “hampering the dea’s investigation of hezbollah would be emblematic of the previous administration’s fixation to strike a nuclear accord with iran at any costs.” “this blind eye imperiled our efforts to combat iran and its proxies’ malign behavior and left us with a cash-flush iran on the warpath across the middle east with a nuclear program legitimized by the jcpoa,” roskam said, using the acronym for the nuclear deal’s official name, the joint comprehensive plan of action. “congress needs to investigate this report and do what the obama administration refused to do, severely increase pressure on hezbollah and hold the terrorist group, and its benefactor iran, accountable for their crimes.”congress is especially interested to learn whether key obama administration officials, such as national security council staffer ben rhodes, were involved in quashing the dea investigation in an effort to preserve diplomatic relations with iran surrounding the nuclear deal. u.s. dea agents who spoke to politico accused the obama administration into derailing an investigation launched during the bush administration into drug trafficking and money laundering by hezbollah. the derailed dea investigation centered on hezbollah and iranian-backed militants, which used wiretaps and undercover operations to gather evidence.delivered by the daily sheeplewe

<NUM>, <NUM>tomorrow the senate banking committee, chaired by senator richard shelby since the republicans took control of the senate in the <NUM> midterms, will hold a hearing on “assessing the effects of consumer finance regulations.” that title can be easily translated into “how to achieve the lobbyists’ dream wish of killing off the consumer financial protection bureau and its embarrassing ability to perpetually show how deregulation of the financial services industry has led to wholesale looting of the public.”senator shelby does not even make a pretense of presenting a balanced slate of witnesses at these hearings and one has to question why the ranking member, senator sherrod brown, a democrat, is not holding shelby’s feet to the fire on this issue.tomorrow’s hearing has three panelists listed: leonard chanin, of counsel at morrison and foerster – a law firm that was a registered lobbyist for the american bankers association last year according to the center for responsive politics; david hirschmann, another registered lobbyist and ceo of the u.s. chamber of commerce center for capital markets competitiveness. the u.s. chamber of commerce has spent $<NUM> million lobbying congress since <NUM> in an effort to gut or water down regulations of wall street and other big corporate groups. (for a more in-depth understanding of what drives the u.s. chamber of commerce, not to be confused with the small business organization in your community known as the chamber of commerce, read susan antilla’s “chamber of commerce gives wall street, polluters what they pay for.”)rounding out tomorrow’s panel is todd zywicki, a senior scholar at the rabidly anti-regulatory mercatus center and a law professor at the related george mason university. according to sourcewatch, the mercatus center “was founded and is funded by the koch family foundations,” the nonprofits set up by the koch brothers to sluice money into a sprawling maze of think tanks, corporate front groups, and university economic departments. sourcewatch reveals that “the koch family has contributed more than thirty million dollars to george mason, much of which has gone to the mercatus center.”one of the luminaries of mercatus center fame is wendy lee gramm, whom the mercatus center archives credits with setting up its “regulatory studies program” in <NUM>. gramm was also the former chair of the commodity futures trading commission (cftc) from <NUM> to january <NUM>, which took a hands off approach to regulating derivatives:according to a report from public citizen:“in <NUM>, as the first step in its business plan to profit on the speculation of energy, enron petitioned the cftc to make regulatory changes that would limit the scope of the commission’s authority over certain kinds of futures contracts. immediately before leaving the cftc, gramm muscled through approval of an unusual draft regulation that would do just that – it narrowed the definition of futures contracts and excluded enron’s energy future contracts and swaps from regulatory oversight. although her actions were criticized by government officials who feared the change would have severe negative consequences (as, in fact, it did), gramm was rewarded five weeks after she left the cftc with a lucrative appointment to enron’s board of directors. between <NUM> and <NUM>, when the company declared bankruptcy, enron paid gramm between $<NUM>,<NUM> and $<NUM>.<NUM> million in salary, attendance fees, stock option sales, and dividends.”enron was a major campaign contributor to wendy lee gramm’s husband, former senator phil gramm, for whom the gramm-leach-bliley act is partially named.gramm-leach-bliley is the legislation signed into law in <NUM> that overturned the seminal consumer protection legislation against bank abuses known as the glass-steagall act. it allowed the gambling casinos of wall street (investment banks and brokerage firms) to merge with commercial banks holding fdic-insured deposits of savers and to use those insured deposits to gamble for the house in unregulated derivatives. (see here and here for how that’s worked out.)what was the koch brothers’ interest in deregulating derivatives? unknown to most americans, in addition to its oil, chemical and lumber interests, koch industries has a sprawling futures trading operation known as koch supply & trading. the koch web site defines the operation thusly:“building on four decades of trading experience, our capabilities are rooted in energy products. our metals and derivatives trading groups have also expanded beyond trading, logistics and operations to pioneer the use of risk-management tools. each of our team members has a role in exchanging some of the world’s most valued commodities.”with offices in financial hubs around the world (london, geneva, amsterdam, singapore, dubai) koch supply & trading is also offering, through its new york office, “energy and metals risk management products to corporate clients and financial institutions.” koch also says its new york office focuses on “trading financial instruments across multiple asset classes, including commodities, fixed income and foreign exchange.”in <NUM>, tim dickinson took an in-depth look for rolling stone magazine into the “toxic empire” of the koch brothers, including koch supply & trading. dickinson reports:“like a casino that bets at its own craps table, koch engages in ‘proprietary trading’ – speculating for the company’s own bottom line. ‘we’re like a hedge fund and a dealer at the same time,’ bragged ilia bouchouev, head of koch’s derivatives trading in <NUM>. ‘we can both make markets and speculate.’ the company’s many tentacles in the physical oil business give koch rich insight into market conditions and disruptions that can inform its speculative bets. when oil prices spiked to record heights in <NUM>, koch was a major player in the speculative markets, according to documents leaked by vermont sen. bernie sanders, with trading volumes rivaling wall street giants like citibank. koch rode a trader-driven

sewage culprit in canadian oyster norovirus outbreakheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!i give credit to the scientists for having a bit of ironic humor in an article recently published about one of the foods i do avoid. i could never recall if it was the months with or without an “r” that you were supposed to avoid eating raw oysters. now, i guess it really does not matter if the water they were grown in contain human feces.bc oysters and norovirus: hundreds of cases in months with an “r”british columbia medical journal, vol. <NUM>, no. <NUM>, july, august <NUM>, page(s) <NUM>,<NUM> bc centre for disease controllorraine mcintyre, msc, eleni galanis, md, mph, frcpc, natalie prystajecky, phd, tom kosatsky, mdbetween november <NUM> and march <NUM> more than <NUM> individuals across canada developed norovirus gastroenteritis associated with the consumption of bc oysters. over <NUM> cases occurred mid-november in participants at a tofino oyster festival. six cases occurred in persons attending a december oyster barbecue in victoria. by march over <NUM> additional cases of norovirus linked to cultivated bc oysters harvested from multiple sites on both the east and west coasts of vancouver island were identified in bc, alberta, and ontario consumers.norovirus is a highly infectious cause of gastroenteritis typically spread from person to person and is associated with regular community outbreaks in schools, hospitals, day cares, and care facilities. foodborne outbreaks of norovirus are often linked to ill food handlers. in this recent outbreak, oysters were contaminated in the marine environment where they were farmed. the trace-back of oysters consumed by infected individuals led to the closure of <NUM> geographically dispersed marine farms in bc (see map) and to extensive public outreach.genotypic analysis of norovirus isolated from the cases included several variants of genogroup i (gi) early in the outbreak and both genogroups gi and gii later in the outbreak.both gi and gii norovirus were detected in oysters from shellfish farms. this suggests that oysters bind and act as a reservoir for community outbreak strains and disseminate those strains to consumers.[<NUM>]although sewage is often the cause of oyster contamination it remains unclear whether one or many sewage sources contributed to the contamination of shellfish farms. the <NUM>–<NUM> outbreak was preceded by a wet fall and accompanied an unseasonably cold winter. wet, cold, and dark winters enhance norovirus survival, allowing for longer retention in ocean sediments and in oysters.[<NUM>,<NUM>] the infective dose of norovirus is estimated as few as <NUM> particles.[<NUM>] given the low infective dose and the viability of norovirus in cold water, we postulate that sewage spread by ocean currents may have contaminated geographically dispersed farms. among potential sources under investigation are sewer overflows, metropolitan and local wastewater treatment plants, municipal raw sewage discharge, and commercial fishing vessels. the bccdc is leading a collaborative group reviewing pollution sources discharging to bc marine environments that may have contaminated bc oysters.in this outbreak, both raw and cooked oysters led to illness; oysters were likely insufficiently cooked to inactivate norovirus. in addition to norovirus, pathogens like vibrio sp., salmonella sp., and hepatitis a can be transmitted to oyster consumers; cooking oysters to an internal temperature of <NUM> °c for at least <NUM> seconds will reduce this risk. the “rule” that shellfish is safe to eat in months with an “r” (september to april) is false. first, bacteria and viruses persist in cold seawater. second, marine biotoxins (saxitoxin and domoic acid that cause paralytic and amnesic shellfish poisoning) occur year round.physicians and laboratories play an important role in controlling foodborne disease. in this outbreak, trace-back of oysters linked to cases was used to close shellfish farms. if you see patients with acute gastroenteritis who recently consumed shellfish, inform your local public health office and submit stool samples for testing.[<NUM>]the authors acknowledge partners in the national outbreak investigation and the environmental transmission of norovirus working

decision to sell advanced lethal weapons systems to the neo-nazi ukrainian regime could easily spiral into a dangerous, self-made, geopolitical crisisjay syrmopouloslast week, the trump administration, reversed its previous position and announced they had agreed to supply advanced lethal defensive weapons to the ukrainian government — including the likely delivery of javelin anti-tank weapons — which could decimate russian armor. this is a move sure to be seen in moscow as a drastic escalation that will almost certainly precipitate a russian retaliation.russian officials denounced president trump’s authorization of lethal equipment to the ukrainians as an aggressive act meant to deliberately sabotage the minsk peace process.“the united states has crossed a line by announcing its intention to supply lethal weapons to ukraine,” russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said saturday. “u.s. weapons are capable of leading to new casualties in our neighboring country, and we cannot remain indifferent to that.”the decision was framed by the state department as one of assisting ukraine to fight back against russian “aggression” and was lauded by congressional war hawks as a necessary step to confront what many neocons and cold war relics see as an expansionist russian foreign policy.state department spokeswoman heather nauert said the weapons were, “part of our effort to help ukraine build its long-term defense capacity, to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to deter further aggression.”proponents of sending the ukrainian government advanced us weapons believe that if they can exact a harsh enough death toll on russian soldiers assisting separatists in the donbas, it will force putin to withdraw support for the separatists.the insane logic being employed by the west shows little understanding of the psychology of russian president vladimir putin.it is simply wishful thinking to believe that a war of attrition, on the border of russia, will force putin to retreat. instead, it will precipitate a drastic escalation in russian support. one need simply analyze the past few years of war in eastern ukraine to clearly see that moscow is willing to take undertake whatever economic, political or military consequences are necessary to prevent the defeat of anti-kiev separatists in the donbas.in <NUM> and <NUM>, when ukrainian soldiers and pro-government neo-nazi battalions were engaging ukrainian separatists in fierce door-to-door, house-to-house fighting, russia didn’t back down – instead, they escalated and forcefully stepped up support – as they supplied not only personnel, but tanks, supplies, and reinforcements to stop kiev’s advances.according to daniel depetris, a fellow at defense priorities, a washington, d.c. thinktank:in putin’s mind, allowing ukraine to retake strategic territory was an unthinkable prospect that would lead kiev to believe that it could squash the rebellion militarily. the infusion of russian troops stopped ukrainian territorial advances in their tracks, at considerable human cost to kiev. in other words, whenever pro-russian militants were losing ground or at risk, moscow turned on the spigot of assistance to prevent a humiliating defeat or retreat. this is one of the biggest reminders to the world community that ukraine’s political disposition is ultimately far more important to russia’s strategic interests than it is to washington’s. no amount of u.s. military equipment or heavy weapons systems is likely to eclipse what the russians will provide to the other side. to believe russia will be intimidated into withdrawing its troops from ukrainian territory or suing for a peace with a government moscow sees as a puppet of the west just because a few more of its soldiers have been killed is to place hope over the reality of putin’s track record throughout the war. whether we in the united states or western europe accept it as legitimate or not, putin is highly motivated to preserve russian influence and freedom of movement in a country that shares a <NUM>,<NUM>-mile border with the russian federation. to allow ukraine to drift fully into europe’s orbit on his watch would be nothing short of a personal political humiliation for putin and, more important, a geopolitical catastrophe for a russia whose political elites remain incredibly nervous about a shrinking near abroad and any hint of political revolution in the former soviet space.the decision to provide advanced lethal weaponry to ukraine will be used by moscow as an excuse to increase its support to ukrainian proxies in the breakaway republics of donetsk and luhansk.the russian government has operated in virtual lockstep with proxy forces since the western coup to depose then ukrainian president viktor yanukovych. although made to look like a spontaneous revolution of the people of ukraine, further study in the wake of the euromaidan revealed a plethora of oligarchic forces called fatherland, neo-nazi ukrainian nationalists, and shadowy intelligence forces operating in concert with western intelligence agencies to create a perfect storm for a “popular revolution” in ukraine.what appeared on the face to be a popular uprising was, in reality, nothing more than a well-scripted coup attempt meant to install a pro-western government in ukraine. the eastern regions of ukraine, with large russian speaking populations, refused to recognize this illegitimate government and requested federalization as to maintain a semblance of autonomy from the pro-western regime that took power. however, the new pro-west government refused and instead sent in military forces to occupy the region. this precipitated local resistance and russian assistance to the local ukrainian forces fighting to defend their home from the newly installed regime in kiev.president trump’s choice to deepen u.s. engagement in a conflict that involves a non-nato country and whose political positioning is largely irrelevant to u.s. policy in europe is a bad decision that has frightening implications regarding the increased potential for conflict with another nuclear superpower.in an article for breaking defense , depetris posited numerous, compelling, unanswered questions that reveal the extremely shortsighted nature of the trump administration’s decision:what, for instance, is the u.s. objective in ukraine other than simply trying to bleed the russians in a proxy conflict? when — not if — russia escalates, what would the trump administration do to counter it? how far is the u.s. willing to go to frustrate moscow’s ambitions in a country it sees as an extension of its former soviet glory? what if putin, in his desire to respond to what he regards as american aggression in his own backyard, seeks to expand the conflict by stirring up pro-moscow sentiment among the russian-speaking populations of the baltics? what would nato do in that situation? is nato even prepared for such a contingency? and if they are not, how is any other eastern european nation supposed to have any confidence in nato when the transatlantic alliance can’t even defend its own members?as dmitri trenin, director of the carnegie moscow center, commented on twitter:the provision of us lethal arms for ukraine will change little on the battlefield, but it marks washington’s deeper and more direct involvement in the conflict. an important line has been crossed, and it probably won’t stop there.",<DATE>

bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!by karl denninger, market ticker:how do you know when a nation is about to collapse?it becomes so lawless that hiding the abuses is no longer necessary. they’re undertaken in full daylight, boldly, by those in charge. and, usually, they start to involve victimizing kids — not so much because it’s easier (it’s plenty easy to victimize adults when nobody goes to prison and you’ve turned every man into a eunuch on top of it) but because you start to run out of adults to vicimize so all that’s left is kids.the poster child for this is of course zuckerberg and facebook, which the founding president of has admitted uses psychological trickery to addict people to the site, and now has chosen to abuse children. you’d think that when a business starts peddling the equivalent of drugs to kids that the cops would show up, haul everyone involved off in chains and destroy the company involved but you’d be wrong — facebook’s stock closed at $<NUM> yesterday, for a market cap of $<NUM> billion. every single penny of that should be forfeit right here, right now.oh, speaking of abusing children, if you’re a sorta little guy you might get arrested for prostituting kids. maybe. it seems that being a state senator is not far enough up the power ladder to evade going to jail. i hope that guy has a nice supply of vasoline, as i have been told prison inmates just loooove those who like to screw kids. now about zucker****er; yeah, i know, it’s not sex — just totally buttraping the future of said kids by diddling their minds so it doesn’t count…. right?it’s just facebook you say, or some state senator? uh, no. how about google and youtube? oh by the way, as youtube “allegedly” tries to “clean this up” i can tell you with certainty that they are de-monetizing videos that absolutely are family-friendly. how do i know? they flagged one of my daughter’s — which featured…… wait for it…… a hike up a hill with her pussy…… cat. there was utterly nothing objectionable in any way, shape or form in that video, but since she was out of town and i noted the lack of ads i filed the protest for her. they turned it back on. instead of looking before killing it in the first place, of course, they just used a computer to do it, you see, because <NUM> seconds of actual looking would have disclosed….. a cat and a hike. it also would have meant google would have made a bit less money to actually employ people, and, well, we can’t have that. jobs? forget about it.then there’s chicago and goldman’s latest fraud, and what a doozey that one is. the city, which incidentally is basically bankrupt and has insane pension liabilities, created a “new” corporation, assigned it alleged “preference” for sales tax revenues, and then had it issue bonds in order to game the ratings. the result? a “aaa” rated bond issue for a bankrupt municipality. may i remind you that if you tried this you’d be tossed in prison for <NUM> years for fraud and the entire set of transactions would be unwound because you cannot structure your finances to avoid paying creditors after the event that gives rise to the liability has happened. for example, you cannot get into a car accident where you’re at fault and then put your assets in a trust to avoid losing them in the ensuing lawsuit.yet that’s exactly what chicago did with goldman’s help to both set it up and run the bond offering. this is blatant and outrageous fraud upon every single previous creditor, and if you or i tried it not only would the transaction be unwound we’d be indicted on top of it. well? where are the handcuffs on rahm and why isn’t goldman shut down right here and now as a criminal enterprise with mr. god’s work being led off in cuffs?then you have the grand-daddy of all, which is quite-clearly outlined here — not that if you’ve read my column you need another example. it deals with the medical scam. just a few miles south having your appendix removed is <NUM>/<NUM>th of the cost of having it done here. the difference? blatant and lawless behavior that violates <NUM>+ year old anti-trust law. this law is not just civil in nature either; it is a felony to even attempt to monopolize trade or commerce.may i remind you that this body of law (<NUM> usc chapter <NUM>, sections <NUM> and <NUM>) do not require that prices go up, although in the case of medical care of all sorts they sure as hell have – by a factor of <NUM> or more. the reason the law was written to not require pricing to increase is that it is extremely common for monopolists to cross-subsidize — that is, screw someone else so you think you’re getting a “deal”. it’s illegal irrespective of price rises (or not) for the precise reason that the people who wrote the law at the time were well-aware that it is trivial for large, powerful corporations to cost-shift and thus hide what they’re doing, making it appear that you’re getting a reasonable deal when in fact they’re jacking people up the cornhole left, right and center.amazon anyone?steve forbes recently wrote on this but he has no sack either for he has refused to use the “f” word — consistently and over decades. see, people don’t want to use the “f” word (no, not ****, felony) because if the american public was to actually start reading said law, and realized that the first two sections consisted of all of a couple of paragraphs and nowhere is there a requirement that prices go up (never mind that they sure as hell have in the medical field) they might pick up pitchforks and torches and demand that people start going to prison right now “or else.”i mean it’s not like hospital administrators (who provide zero care to patients) have risen in count by over <NUM>,<NUM>% while doctors have risen by something like <NUM>% from <NUM> to today, or medical costs have gone up <NUM>% while wages have risen <NUM>%. oh wait…..people have told me that i’m being completely unrealistic when i point out that fixing this would cause medical costs to drop by <NUM>% or more, making “insurance” completely unnecessary for <NUM>% of all things medical and the cost of insurance for the remaining <NUM>% about as expensive on an annual basis as one nice night out on the town. in other words with the exception of the truly destitute nobody would need any help at all from government or anywhere else.don’t tell me that this outcome is impossible either; if you’re older than <NUM> or so your parents did exactly that when you were a child. were you stoned when you were six or are you intentionally refusing to face facts? i remember the doctor’s office — exactly where the building was, the waiting room (divided into two sections; one for well kids there for routine things, the other for sick kids — an attempt to avoid getting the well kids sick!), the front desk (where you paid, natch) and the little exam rooms. i also remember my very-much middle class mother writing a check for the modest cost incurred. there were no insurance cards and no angst about a visit to the doctor, if you really needed one. you called, you showed up, you had whatever you needed attended to taken care of, you wrote a check and left.that’s because it didn’t bankrupt you.read more @ market-ticker.orgsource:

tiny homeheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!while a tiny home is great because of its low price compared to a bigger property, the limitations on space mean you must make other adjustments with how you furnish it. a certain degree of creative thinking is needed to fit in the kind of useful things that will help make the place feel homely but also not cramped at the same time.royalty free photothere are also a few essentials that you’ll find you won’t want to go without regardless of space considerations. think about how much each item weighs because one of the points of a tiny home is going minimalist in the number and the weight of all your possessions.let’s take a look at four useful items that your tiny home cannot easily do without.washer & dryer machinewhile it’s possible to do without the washer and dryer equipment, having to trek your dirty laundry down to the laundromat every week gets old real fast. if you don’t have a car, you’ll have to carry it over your shoulder or in a backpack which won’t be too comfortable either. it’s true that making the space for the washing in your tiny home isn’t easy, but it’s well worth it. to cut down on the floor space used, there are combination units you can buy to avoid having separate ones. pair the washer and dryer machine with a drying rack that works both inside or outside your home (weather dependent) and you’re all set.space heaterit might be warm enough now, but when the temperature drops you will be glad you bought a space heater to warm up the place. these products are now more energy efficient than in the past with thermostats to turn them off when the home reaches an agreeable temperature. they are also not as expensive to run as you’d think because you’re not having to heat multiple rooms; the warmth spreads around the home evenly as it radiates out.small refrigeratorwhen it comes to the refrigerator, there are a good number of choices available. you can, of course, look for a tall refrigerator to take maximum advantage of the height of your home. however, these units do use considerable amounts of energy. a compact refrigerator that might even fit under a well-designed kitchen counter top is ideal because you can reach it without having to stretch up. alternatively, installing a refrigerator under the stairs or as part of a wall are other options if you’re really trying to save space and don’t care about the unit being in the kitchen area.composting toilet facilityhaving a toilet is a must for most tiny home owners. you don’t want to have to rely on local facilities in the dead of night when you get caught short. the composting version doesn’t use water and is environmentally friendly. it’s easy to empty on a regular basis and doesn’t take up too much space either. there’s also no black water tank, so it’s more convenient that way too.your tiny home doesn’t need too many items to feel comfy, but there are some that we’d think are essential to your overall enjoyment. you want to avoid adding too many extras in your tiny home as the point is to live small, but there are some things you just cannot do without.",<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<DATE> <NUM>:<NUM>:<NUM>.<NUM>,<NUM> useful items for your tiny home,dimitry
