    "<b> Describe the tools used and the challenges faced when creating the dataframe. </b> <br>\n",
    "When creating the articleList function, which returns a list of links referring to all the articles, the temp function uses the beautifulSoup html.parser and the find_all property to get a string with the content division element that contains all the needed links. Temp takes a letter as input and concatenates this letter to the Wikinews link. The following letters: K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, and U are run on temp inside the articleList function by splitting the list from the assignment description and running it in a for-loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas dataframe is created in the createTable function. A for-loop goes through all the links and readies the text for cleaning using request and bs4; the string is then fed to a tuple of functions that extract the relevant data. This data is then appended to a list and pasted into a Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the three cleaning functions, getContent unraveled the most challenges. The first challenge was that the content consisted of multiple chunks of phrases. To deal with this defContent creates a list of all \\<p\\>'s and converts every list element into strings. The join function then unpacks the list to prepare a string for cleaning. This leads to the next challenge: cleaning the data in a helper function called cleanAll. cleanAll consists of regular expressions that remove the date and unwanted tags. When looking at the HTML code, I noticed that the content is always appearing before the tags \\<br\\>, \\<img\\>, and \\<b\\>. Therefore everything coming after one of these tags is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Assess whether it is a reasonable choice to trust the sources when they aren't labeled. </b> <br>\n",
    "If it's assumed that whoever created the list of articles only included articles they believed were legit (or at least wanted the reader to think were legit), such labels would come from the same source and therefore have the same credibility. Because of this, the existence of labels doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the list to practice programming skills, it doesn't matter either. The code would be identical if the articles were written in lorem ipsum. "
